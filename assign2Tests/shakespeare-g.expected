tall that i did suit me all points like a man a gallant curtleaxe upon my thigh a boar spear in my hand and in my heart lie there what hidden womans fear there will well have a swashing and a martial outside as many other mannish cowards have that do outface it with their semblances celia what shall i call thee when thou art a man rosalind ill have no worse a name than joves own page and therefore

amiens and two or three lords like foresters duke senior now my comates and brothers in exile hath not old custom made this life more sweet than that of painted pomp are not these woods more free from peril than the envious court here feel we not the penalty of adam the seasons difference as the icy fang and churlish chiding of the winters wind which when it bites and blows upon my body even till i shrink with cold i smile and say this is no flattery these are counsellors that feelingly persuade me what i am sweet are the uses of adversity which like the toad ugly and venomous wears yet a precious jewel in his head and this our life exempt from public haunt finds tongues in trees books in the running brooks sermons in stones and good in everything i would not change it amiens happy is your grace that can translate the stubbornness of fortune into so quiet and so sweet a style duke senior come shall we go and kill us venison and yet it irks me the poor dappled fools being native burghers of this desert city should in their own confines with forked heads have their round haunches gord first lord indeed my lord the melancholy jaques grieves at that and in that kind swears you do more usurp than doth your brother that hath banishd you today my lord of amiens and myself did steal behind him as he lay along under an oak whose antique root peeps out upon the brook that brawls along this wood to the which place a poor sequestred stag that from the hunters aim had taen a hurt did come to languish and indeed my lord the wretched animal heavd forth such groans that their discharge did stretch his leathern coat almost to bursting and the big round tears coursd one another down his innocent nose in piteous chase and thus the hairy fool much marked of the melancholy jaques stood on th extremest verge of the swift brook augmenting it with tears duke senior but what said jaques did he not moralize this spectacle first lord o yes into a thousand similes first for his weeping into the needless stream poor deer quoth he thou makst a testament as worldlings do giving thy sum of more to that which had too much then being there alone left and abandoned of his velvet friends tis right quoth he thus misery doth part the flux of company anon a careless herd full of the pasture jumps along by him and never stays to greet him ay quoth jaques sweep on you fat and greasy citizens tis just the fashion wherefore do you look upon that poor and broken bankrupt there thus most invectively he pierceth through the body of the country city court yea and of this our life swearing that we are mere usurpers tyrants and whats worse to fright the animals and to kill them up in their assignd and native dwellingplace duke senior and did you leave him in this contemplation second lord we did my lord weeping and commenting upon the sobbing deer duke senior show me the place i love to cope him in these sullen fits for then hes full of matter first lord ill

second lord my lord the roynish clown at whom so oft your grace was wont to laugh is also missing hisperia the princess gentlewoman confesses that she secretly oerheard your daughter and her cousin much commend the parts and graces of the wrestler that did but lately foil the sinewy charles and she believes wherever they are gone that youth is surely in their company frederick send to his brother fetch that gallant hither if he be absent bring his brother to me ill make him find him do this suddenly and let not search and inquisition quail to bring again these foolish runaways exeunt

presents more woeful pageants than the scene wherein we play in jaques all the worlds a stage and all the men and women merely players they have their exits and their entrances and one man in his time plays many parts his acts being seven ages at first the infant mewling and puking in the nurses arms then the whining schoolboy with his satchel and shining morning face creeping like snail unwillingly to school and then the lover sighing like furnace with a woeful ballad made to his mistress eyebrow then a soldier full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard jealous in honour sudden and quick in quarrel seeking the bubble reputation even in the cannons mouth and then the justice in fair round belly with good capon lind with eyes severe and beard of formal cut full of wise saws and modern instances and so he plays his part the sixth age shifts into the lean and slipperd pantaloon with spectacles on nose and pouch on side his youthful hose well savd a world too wide for his shrunk shank and his big manly voice turning again toward childish treble pipes and whistles in his sound last scene of all that ends this strange eventful history is second childishness and mere

rosalind then there is no true lover in the forest else sighing every minute and groaning every hour would detect the lazy foot of time as well as a clock orlando and why not the swift foot of time had not that been as proper rosalind by no means sir time travels in divers paces with divers persons ill tell you who time ambles withal who time trots withal who time gallops withal and who he stands still withal orlando i prithee who doth he trot withal rosalind marry he trots hard with a young maid between the contract of her marriage and the day it is solemnizd if the interim be but a sennight times pace is so hard that it seems the length of seven year orlando who ambles time withal rosalind with a priest that lacks latin and a rich man that hath not the gout for the one sleeps easily because he cannot study and the other lives merrily because he feels no pain the one lacking the burden of lean and wasteful learning the other knowing no burden of heavy tedious penury these time ambles withal orlando who doth he gallop withal rosalind with a thief to the gallows for though he go as softly as foot can fall he thinks himself too soon there orlando who stays it still withal rosalind with lawyers in the vacation for they sleep between term and term and then they perceive not how time moves orlando where dwell you pretty youth rosalind with this shepherdess my sister here in the skirts of the forest like fringe upon a petticoat orlando are you native of this place rosalind as the coney that you see dwell where she is kindled orlando your accent is something finer than you could purchase in so removed a dwelling rosalind i have been told so of many but indeed an old religious uncle of mine taught me to speak who was in his youth an inland man one that knew courtship too well for there he fell in love i have heard him read many lectures against it and i thank god i am not a woman to be touchd with so many giddy offences as he hath generally taxd their whole sex withal orlando can you remember any of the principal evils that he laid to the charge of women rosalind there were none principal they were all like one another as halfpence are every one fault seeming monstrous till his fellowfault came to match it orlando i prithee recount some of them rosalind no i will not cast away my physic but on those that are sick there is a man haunts the forest that abuses our young plants with carving rosalind on their barks hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegies on brambles all forsooth deifying the name of rosalind if i could meet that fancymonger i would give him some good counsel for he seems to have the quotidian of love upon him orlando i am he that is so loveshakd i pray you tell me your remedy rosalind there is none of my uncles marks upon you he taught me how to know a man in love in which cage of rushes i am sure you are not prisoner orlando what were his marks rosalind a lean cheek which you have not a blue eye and sunken which you have not an unquestionable spirit which you have not a beard neglected which you have not but i pardon you for that for simply your having in beard is a younger brothers revenue then your hose should be ungarterd your bonnet unbanded your sleeve unbuttond your shoe untied and every thing about you demonstrating a careless desolation but you are no such man you are rather pointdevice in your accoutrements as loving yourself than seeming the lover of any other orlando fair youth i would i could make thee believe i love rosalind me believe it you may as soon make her that you love believe it which i warrant she is apter to do than to confess she does that is one of the points in the which women still give the lie to their consciences but in good sooth are you he that hangs the verses on the trees wherein rosalind is so admired orlando i swear to thee youth by the white hand of rosalind i am that he that unfortunate he rosalind but are you so much in love as your rhymes speak orlando neither rhyme nor reason can express how much rosalind love is merely a madness and i tell you deserves as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do and the reason why they are not so punishd and cured is that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers are in love too yet i profess curing it by counsel orlando did you ever cure any so rosalind yes one and in this manner he was to imagine me his love his mistress and i set him every day to woo me at which time would i being but a moonish youth grieve be effeminate changeable longing and liking proud fantastical apish shallow inconstant full of tears full of smiles for every passion something and for no passion truly anything as boys and women are for the most part cattle of this colour would now like him now loathe him then

thou canst not o for shame for shame lie not to say mine eyes are murderers now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee scratch thee but with a pin and there remains some scar of it lean upon a rush

recompense than thine own gladness that thou art employd silvius so holy and so perfect is my love and i in such a poverty of grace that i shall think it a most plenteous crop to glean the broken ears

and he hath bought the cottage and the bounds that the old carlot once was master of phebe think not i love him though i ask for him tis but a peevish boy yet he talks well but what care i for words yet words do well when he that speaks them pleases those that hear it is a pretty youth not very pretty but sure hes proud and yet his pride becomes him hell make a proper man the best thing in him is his complexion and faster than his tongue did make offence his eye did heal it up he is not very tall yet for his years hes tall his leg is but soso and yet tis well there was a pretty redness in his lip a little riper and more lusty red than that mixd in his cheek twas just the difference betwixt the constant red and mingled damask there be some women silvius had they markd him in parcels as i did would have gone near to fall in love with him but for my part i love him not nor hate him not and yet i have more cause to hate him than to love him for what had he to do to chide at me he said mine eyes were black and my hair black and now i am remembred scornd at me i marvel why i answerd not again but thats all one omittance is no quittance ill write to him a very taunting letter and thou

nothing rosalind why then tis good to be a post jaques i have neither the scholars melancholy which is emulation nor the musicians which is fantastical nor the courtiers which is proud nor the soldiers which is ambitious nor the lawyers which is politic nor the ladys which is nice nor the lovers which is all these but it is a melancholy of mine own compounded of many simples extracted from many objects and indeed the sundry contemplation of my travels in which my often rumination wraps me in a most humorous sadness rosalind a traveller by my faith you have great reason to be sad i fear you have sold your own lands to see other mens then to have seen much and to have nothing is to have rich eyes and poor hands jaques yes i have gaind my experience enter orlando rosalind and your experience makes you sad i had rather have a fool to make me merry than experience to make me sad and to travel for it too orlando good day and happiness dear rosalind jaques nay then god buy you an you talk in blank verse rosalind farewell monsieur traveller look you lisp and wear strange suits disable all the benefits of your own country be out of love with your nativity and almost chide god

fortune and prevents the slander of his wife orlando virtue is no hornmaker and my rosalind is virtuous rosalind and i am your rosalind celia it pleases him to call you so but he hath a rosalind of a better leer than you rosalind come woo me woo me for now i am in a holiday humour and like enough to consent what would you say to me now an i were your very very rosalind orlando i would kiss before i spoke rosalind nay you were better speak first and when you were gravelld for lack of matter you might take occasion to kiss very good orators when they are out they will spit and for lovers lacking god warn us matter the cleanliest shift is to kiss orlando how if the kiss be denied rosalind then she puts you to entreaty and there begins new matter orlando who could be out being before his beloved mistress rosalind marry that should you if i were your mistress or i should think my honesty ranker than my wit orlando what of my suit rosalind not out of your apparel and yet out of your suit am not i your rosalind orlando i take some joy to say you are because i would be talking of her rosalind well in her person i say i will not have you orlando then in mine own person i die rosalind no faith die by attorney the poor world is almost six thousand years old and in all this time there was not any man died in his own person videlicet in a lovecause troilus had his brains dashd out with a grecian club yet he did what he could to die before and he is one of the patterns of love leander he would have livd many a fair year though hero had turnd nun if it had not been for a hot midsummer night for good youth he went but forth to wash him in the hellespont and being taken with the cramp was drownd and the foolish chroniclers of that age found it was hero of sestos but these are all lies men have died from time to time and worms have eaten them but not for love orlando i would not have my right rosalind of this mind for i protest her frown might kill me rosalind by this hand it will not kill a fly but come now i will be your rosalind in a more comingon disposition and ask me what you will i will grant it orlando then love me rosalind rosalind yes faith will i fridays and saturdays and all orlando and wilt thou have me rosalind ay and twenty such orlando what sayest thou rosalind are you not good orlando i hope so rosalind why then can one desire too much of a good thing come sister you shall be the priest and marry us give me your hand orlando what do you say sister orlando pray thee marry us celia i cannot say the words rosalind you must begin will

wife orlando i take thee rosalind for wife rosalind i might ask you for your commission but i do take thee orlando for my husband theres a girl goes before the priest and certainly a womans thought runs before her actions orlando so do all thoughts they are wingd rosalind now tell me how long you would have her after you have possessd her orlando for ever and a day rosalind say a day without the ever no no orlando men are april when they woo december when they wed maids are may when they are maids but the sky changes when they are wives i will be more jealous of thee than a barbary cockpigeon over his hen more clamorous than a parrot against rain more newfangled than an ape more giddy in my desires than a monkey i will weep for nothing like diana in the fountain and i will do that when you are disposd to be merry i will laugh like a hyen and that when thou are inclind to sleep orlando but will my rosalind do so rosalind by my life she will do as i do orlando o but she is wise rosalind or else she could not have the wit to do this the wiser the waywarder make the doors upon a womans wit and it will out at the casement shut that and twill out at the keyhole stop that twill fly with the smoke out at the chimney orlando a man that had a wife with such a wit he might say wit whither wilt rosalind nay you might keep that check for it till you met your wifes wit going to your neighbours bed orlando and what wit could wit have to excuse that rosalind marry to say she came to seek you there you shall never take her without her answer unless you take her without her tongue o that woman that cannot make her fault her husbands occasion let her never nurse her child herself for she will breed it like a fool orlando for these two hours rosalind i will leave thee rosalind alas dear love i cannot lack thee two hours orlando i must attend the duke at dinner by two oclock i will be with thee again rosalind ay go your ways go your ways i knew what you would prove my friends told me as much and i thought no less that flattering tongue of yours won me tis but one cast away and so come death two oclock is your hour orlando ay sweet rosalind rosalind by my troth and in good earnest and so god mend me and by all pretty oaths that are not dangerous if you break one jot of your promise or come one minute behind your hour i will think you the most pathetical breakpromise and the most hollow lover and the most unworthy of her you call rosalind that may be chosen out of the gross band of the unfaithful therefore beware my censure and keep your promise orlando with no less religion than if thou wert indeed my rosalind so adieu rosalind well time is the old justice that examines all such offenders and let time try adieu exit orlando celia you have simply misusd our sex

reads art thou god to shepherd turnd that a maidens heart hath burnd can a woman rail thus silvius call you this railing rosalind why thy godhead laid apart warrst thou with a womans heart did you

handkercher was staind celia i pray you tell it oliver when last the young orlando parted from you he left a promise to return again within an hour and pacing through the forest chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy lo what befell he threw his eye aside and mark what object did present itself under an oak whose boughs were mossd with age and high top bald with dry antiquity a wretched ragged man oergrown with hair lay sleeping on his back about his neck a green and gilded snake had wreathd itself who with her head nimble in threats approachd the opening of his mouth but suddenly seeing orlando it unlinkd itself and with indented glides did slip away into a bush under which bushs shade a lioness with udders all drawn dry lay couching head on ground with catlike watch when that the sleeping man should stir for tis the royal disposition of that beast to prey on nothing that doth seem as dead this seen orlando did approach the man and found it was his brother his elder brother celia o i have heard him speak of that same brother and he did render him the most unnatural that livd amongst men oliver and well he might so do for well i know he was unnatural rosalind but to orlando did he leave him there food to the suckd and hungry lioness oliver twice did he turn his back and purposd so but kindness nobler ever than revenge and nature stronger than his just occasion made him give battle to the lioness who quickly fell before him in which hurtling from miserable slumber i awakd celia are you his brother rosalind wast you he rescud celia wast you that did so oft contrive to kill him oliver twas i but tis not i i do not shame to tell you what i was since my conversion so sweetly tastes being the thing i am rosalind but for the bloody napkin oliver by and by

entertainment committing me unto my brothers love who led me instantly unto his cave there strippd himself and here upon his arm the lioness had torn some flesh away which all this while had bled and now he fainted and cried in fainting upon rosalind brief i recoverd him bound up his wound and after some small space being strong at heart he sent me hither stranger as i am to tell this story that you might excuse his broken promise and to give this napkin dyd in his blood unto the shepherd youth that he in sport doth call his rosalind rosalind swoons celia why how now ganymede sweet ganymede

born and wed unto a woman happy but for me and by me had not our hap been bad with her i livd in joy our wealth increasd by prosperous voyages i often made to epidamnum till my factors death and the great care of goods at random left drew me from kind embracements of my spouse from whom my absence was not six months old before herself almost at fainting under the pleasing punishment that women bear had made provision for her following me and soon and safe arrived where i was there had she not been long but she became a joyful mother of two goodly sons and which was strange the one so like

may pity though not pardon thee aegeon o had the gods done so i had not now worthily termd them merciless to us for ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues we were encountred by a mighty rock

poor soul seeming as burdened with lesser weight but not with lesser woe was carried with more speed before the wind and in our sight they three were taken up by fishermen of corinth as we thought at length another ship had seizd on us and knowing whom it was their hap to save gave healthful welcome to their shipwreckd guests and would have reft the fishers of their prey had not their bark been very slow of sail and therefore homeward did they bend their course thus have you heard me severd from my bliss that by misfortunes was my life prolongd to tell sad stories of my own mishaps duke and

shrink with cold i smile and say this is no flattery these are counsellors that feelingly persuade me what i am sweet are the uses of adversity which like the toad ugly and venomous wears yet a precious jewel in his head and this our life exempt from public haunt finds tongues in trees books in the running brooks sermons in stones and good in everything i would not change it amiens happy is

along this wood to the which place a poor sequestred stag that from the hunters aim had taen a hurt did come to languish and indeed my lord the wretched animal heavd forth such groans that their discharge did stretch his leathern coat almost to bursting and the big round tears coursd one another down his innocent nose in piteous chase and thus the hairy fool much marked of the melancholy jaques stood on th extremest verge of the swift brook augmenting it with tears duke senior but what said jaques did he not moralize this spectacle first lord o yes into a thousand similes first for his weeping into the needless stream poor deer quoth he thou makst a testament as worldlings do giving thy sum of more to that which had too much then being there alone left and abandoned of his velvet friends tis right quoth he thus misery doth part the flux of company anon a careless herd full of the pasture jumps along by him and never stays to greet him ay quoth jaques sweep on you fat and greasy citizens tis just the fashion wherefore do you look upon that poor and broken bankrupt there thus most invectively he pierceth through the body of the country city court yea and of this our life swearing that we are mere usurpers tyrants and whats worse to fright the animals and to kill them up in their assignd and native dwellingplace duke senior and did you leave him in this

discord in the spheres go seek him tell him i would speak with him enter jaques first lord he saves my labour by his own approach duke senior why how now monsieur what a life is this that your poor friends must woo your company what you look merrily jaques a fool a fool i met a fool i th forest a motley fool a miserable world as i do live by food i met a fool who laid him down and baskd him in the sun and raild on lady fortune in good terms in good set terms and yet a motley fool good morrow fool quoth i no sir quoth he call me not fool till heaven hath sent me fortune and then he drew a dial from his poke and looking on it with lacklustre eye says very wisely it is ten oclock thus we may see quoth he how the world wags tis but an hour ago since it was nine and after one hour more twill be eleven and so from hour to hour we ripe and ripe and then from hour to hour we rot and rot and thereby hangs a tale when i did hear the motley fool thus moral on the time my lungs began to crow like chanticleer that fools should be so deep contemplative and i did laugh sans intermission an hour by his dial o noble fool a worthy fool motleys the only wear duke senior what fool is this jaques o worthy fool one that hath been a courtier and says if ladies be but young and fair they have the gift to know it and in his brain which is as dry as the remainder biscuit after a voyage he hath strange places crammd with observation the which he vents in mangled forms o that i were a fool i am ambitious for a motley coat duke senior thou shalt have one jaques it is my only suit provided that you weed your better judgments of all opinion that grows rank in them that i am wise i must have liberty withal as large a charter as the wind to blow on whom i please for so fools have and they that are most galled with my folly they most must laugh and why sir must they so the why is plain as way to parish church he that a fool doth very wisely hit doth very foolishly although he smart not to seem senseless of the bob if not the wise mans folly is anatomizd even by the squandring glances of the fool invest me in my motley give me leave to speak my mind and i will through and through cleanse the foul body of th infected world if they will patiently receive my medicine duke senior fie on thee i can tell what thou wouldst do jaques what for a counter would i do but good duke senior most mischievous foul sin in chiding sin for thou thyself hast been a libertine as sensual as the brutish sting itself and all th embossed sores and headed evils that thou with license of free foot hast caught wouldst thou disgorge into the general world jaques why who cries out on pride that can therein tax any private party doth it not flow as hugely as the sea till that the wearers very means do ebb what woman in the city do i name when that i say the citywoman bears the cost of princes on unworthy shoulders who can come in and say that i mean her when such a one as she such is her neighbour or what is he of basest function that says his bravery is not on my cost thinking that i mean him but therein suits his folly to the mettle of my speech there then how then what then let me see wherein my tongue hath wrongd him if it do him right then he hath wrongd himself if he be free why then my taxing like a wildgoose flies unclaimd of any man but who comes here enter orlando with his sword drawn orlando forbear and eat no more jaques why i have eat none yet orlando nor shalt not till necessity be servd jaques of what kind should this cock come of duke senior art thou thus

if ever sat at any good mans feast if ever from your eyelids wipd a tear and know what tis to pity and be pitied let gentleness my strong enforcement be in the which hope i blush and hide my sword duke senior true is it that we have seen better days and have with holy bell been knolld to church and sat at good mens feasts and wipd our eyes of drops that sacred pity hath engendred and therefore sit you down in gentleness and take upon command what help we have that to your wanting may be ministred orlando then but forbear your food a little while whiles like a doe i go to find my fawn and

find him out and we will nothing waste till you return orlando i thank ye and be blest for your good comfort exit duke senior thou seest we are not all alone unhappy this wide and universal theatre presents more woeful pageants than the scene wherein we play in jaques all the worlds a stage and all the men and women merely players they have their exits and their entrances and one man in his time plays many parts his acts being seven ages at first the infant mewling and puking in the nurses arms then the whining schoolboy with his satchel and shining morning face creeping like snail unwillingly to school and then the lover sighing like furnace with a woeful ballad made to his mistress eyebrow then a soldier full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard jealous in honour sudden and quick in quarrel seeking the bubble reputation even in the cannons mouth and then the justice in fair round belly with good capon lind with eyes severe and beard of formal cut full of wise saws and modern instances and so he plays his part the sixth age shifts into the lean and slipperd pantaloon with spectacles on nose and pouch on side his youthful hose well savd a world too wide for his shrunk shank and his big manly voice turning again toward childish treble pipes and whistles in his sound last scene of all that ends this strange eventful history is second childishness and mere

jaques i do not like her name orlando there was no thought of pleasing you when she was christend jaques what stature is she of orlando just as high as my heart jaques you are full of pretty answers have you not been acquainted with goldsmiths wives and connd them out of rings orlando not so but i answer you right painted cloth from whence you have studied your questions jaques you have a nimble wit i think twas made of atalantas heels will you sit down with me and we two will rail against our mistress the world and all our misery orlando i will chide no breather in the world but myself against whom i know most faults jaques the worst fault you have is to be in love orlando tis a fault i will not change for your best virtue i am weary of you jaques by my troth i was seeking for a fool when i found you orlando he is drownd in the brook look but in and you shall see him jaques there i shall see mine own figure orlando which i take to be either a fool or a cipher jaques ill tarry

rosalind then there is no true lover in the forest else sighing every minute and groaning every hour would detect the lazy foot of time as well as a clock orlando and why not the swift foot of time had not that been as proper rosalind by no means sir time travels in divers paces with divers persons ill tell you who time ambles withal who time trots withal who time gallops withal and who he stands still withal orlando i prithee who doth he trot withal rosalind marry he trots hard with a young maid between the contract of her marriage and the day it is solemnizd if the interim be but a sennight times pace is so hard that it seems the length of seven year orlando who ambles time withal rosalind with a priest that lacks latin and a rich man that hath not the gout for the one sleeps easily because he cannot study and the other lives merrily because he feels no pain the one lacking the burden of lean and wasteful learning the other knowing no burden of heavy tedious penury these time ambles withal orlando who doth he gallop withal rosalind with a thief to the gallows for though he go as softly as foot can fall he thinks himself too soon there orlando who stays it still withal rosalind with lawyers in the vacation for they sleep between term and term and then they perceive not how time moves orlando where dwell you pretty youth rosalind with this shepherdess my sister here in the skirts of the forest like fringe upon a petticoat orlando are you native of this place rosalind as the coney that you see dwell where she is kindled orlando your accent is something finer than you could purchase in so removed a dwelling rosalind i have been told so of many but indeed an old religious uncle of mine taught me to speak who was in his youth an inland man one that knew courtship too well for there he fell in love i have heard him read many lectures against it and i thank god i am not a woman to be touchd with so many giddy offences as he hath generally taxd their whole sex withal orlando can you remember any of the principal evils that he laid to the charge of women rosalind there were none principal they were all like one another as halfpence are every one fault seeming monstrous till his fellowfault came to match it orlando i prithee recount some of them rosalind no i will not cast away my physic but on those that are sick there is a man haunts the forest that abuses our young plants with carving rosalind on their barks hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegies on brambles all forsooth deifying the name of rosalind if i could meet that fancymonger i would give him some good counsel for he seems to have the quotidian of love upon him orlando i am he that is so loveshakd i pray you tell me your remedy rosalind there is none of my uncles marks upon you he taught me how to know a man in love in which cage of rushes i am sure you are not prisoner orlando what were his marks rosalind a lean cheek which you have not a blue eye and sunken which you have not an unquestionable spirit which you have not a beard neglected which you have not but i pardon you for that for simply your having in beard is a younger brothers revenue then your hose should be ungarterd your bonnet unbanded your sleeve unbuttond your shoe untied and every thing about you demonstrating a careless desolation but you are no such man you are rather pointdevice in your accoutrements as loving yourself than seeming the lover of any other orlando fair youth i would i could make thee believe i love rosalind me believe it you may as soon make her that you love believe it which i warrant she is apter to do than to confess she does that is one of the points in the which women still give the lie to their consciences but in good sooth are you he that hangs the verses on the trees wherein rosalind is so admired orlando i swear to thee youth by the white hand of rosalind i am that he that unfortunate he rosalind but are you so much in love as your rhymes speak orlando neither rhyme nor reason can express how much rosalind love is merely a madness and i tell you deserves as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do and the reason why they are not so punishd and cured is that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers are in love too yet i profess curing it by counsel orlando did you ever cure any so rosalind yes one and in this manner he was to imagine me his love his mistress and i set him every day to woo me at which time would i being but a moonish youth grieve be effeminate changeable longing and liking proud fantastical apish shallow inconstant full of tears full of smiles for every passion something and for no passion truly anything as boys and women are for the most part cattle of this colour would now like him now loathe him then entertain him then forswear him now weep for him then spit at him that i drave my suitor from his mad humour of love to a living humour of madness which was to forswear the full stream of the world and to live in a nook merely monastic and thus i curd him and this way will i take upon me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheeps heart that there shall not be one spot of love in t orlando i would not be cured youth rosalind i would cure you if you would but call me rosalind and come every day to my cote and woo me orlando now by the faith of my love i will tell me where it is rosalind go

great reckoning in a little room truly i would the gods had made thee poetical audrey i do not know what poetical is is it honest in deed and word is it a true thing touchstone no truly for the truest poetry is the most feigning and lovers are given to poetry and what they swear in poetry may be said as lovers they do feign audrey do you wish then that the gods had made me poetical touchstone i do truly for thou swearst to me thou art honest now if thou wert a poet i might have some hope thou didst feign audrey would you not have me honest touchstone no truly unless thou wert hardfavourd for honesty coupled to beauty is to have honey a sauce to sugar jaques aside a material fool audrey well i am not fair and therefore i pray the gods make me honest touchstone truly and to cast away

well that is the dowry of his wife tis none of his own getting horns even so poor men alone no no the noblest deer hath them as huge as the rascal is the single man therefore blessed no as a walld town is more worthier than a village so is the forehead of a married man more honourable than the bare brow of a bachelor and by how much defence is better than no skill by so much is horn more precious than to want here comes sir oliver enter sir oliver martext sir oliver martext you are well met will you dispatch us here under this tree or shall we go with you to your chapel martext is

wainscot then one of you will prove a shrunk panel and like green timber warp warp touchstone aside i am not in the mind but i were better to be married of him than of another for he is not like to

dissembling colour celia something browner than judass marry his kisses are judass own children rosalind i faith his hair is of a good colour celia an excellent colour your chestnut was ever the only colour rosalind and his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch of holy bread celia he hath bought a pair of cast lips of diana a nun of winters sisterhood kisses not more religiously the very ice of chastity is in them rosalind but why did he swear he would come this morning and comes not celia nay certainly there is no truth in him rosalind do you think so celia yes i think he is not a

but what talk we of fathers when there is such a man as orlando celia o thats a brave man he writes brave verses speaks brave words swears brave oaths and breaks them bravely quite traverse athwart

recompense than thine own gladness that thou art employd silvius so holy and so perfect is my love and i in such a poverty of grace that i shall think it a most plenteous crop to glean the broken ears

and he hath bought the cottage and the bounds that the old carlot once was master of phebe think not i love him though i ask for him tis but a peevish boy yet he talks well but what care i for words yet words do well when he that speaks them pleases those that hear it is a pretty youth not very pretty but sure hes proud and yet his pride becomes him hell make a proper man the best thing in him is his complexion and faster than his tongue did make offence his eye did heal it up he is not very tall yet for his years hes tall his leg is but soso and yet tis well there was a pretty redness in his lip a little riper and more lusty red than that mixd in his cheek twas just the difference betwixt the constant red and mingled damask there be some women silvius had they markd him in parcels as i did would have gone near to fall in love with him but for my part i love him not nor hate him not and yet i have more cause to hate him than to love him for what had he to do to chide at me he said

soldiers which is ambitious nor the lawyers which is politic nor the ladys which is nice nor the lovers which is all these but it is a melancholy of mine own compounded of many simples extracted from many objects and indeed the sundry contemplation of my travels in which my often rumination wraps me in a most humorous sadness rosalind a traveller by my faith you have great reason to be sad i fear you have sold your own lands to see other mens then to have seen much and to have nothing is to have rich eyes and poor hands jaques yes i have gaind my experience enter orlando rosalind and your experience makes you sad i had rather have a fool to make me merry than experience to make me sad and to travel for it too orlando good day and happiness dear rosalind jaques nay then god buy you an

dashd out with a grecian club yet he did what he could to die before and he is one of the patterns of love leander he would have livd many a fair year though hero had turnd nun if it had not been for a hot midsummer night for good youth he went but forth to wash him in the hellespont and being taken with the cramp was drownd and the foolish chroniclers of that age found it was hero of sestos but these are all lies men have died from time to time and worms have eaten them but not for love orlando i would not have my right rosalind of this mind for i protest her frown might kill me rosalind by this hand it will not kill a fly but come now i will be your rosalind in a more comingon disposition and ask me what you will i will grant it orlando then love me rosalind rosalind yes faith will i

are disposd to be merry i will laugh like a hyen and that when thou are inclind to sleep orlando but will my rosalind do so rosalind by my life she will do as i do orlando o but she is wise rosalind or else she could not have the wit to do this the wiser the waywarder make the doors upon a womans wit and it will out at the casement shut that and twill out at the keyhole stop that twill fly with the smoke out at the chimney orlando a man that had a wife with such a wit he might say wit whither wilt rosalind nay you might keep that check for it till you met your wifes wit going to your neighbours bed orlando and what wit could wit have to excuse that rosalind marry to say she came to seek you there you shall never take her without her answer unless you take her without her tongue o that woman that cannot make her fault her husbands occasion let her never nurse her child herself for she will breed it like a fool orlando for these two hours rosalind i will leave thee rosalind alas

earnest and so god mend me and by all pretty oaths that are not dangerous if you break one jot of your promise or come one minute behind your hour i will think you the most pathetical breakpromise and the most hollow lover and the most unworthy of her you call rosalind that may be chosen out of the gross band of the unfaithful therefore beware my censure and keep your promise orlando with no less

sweet and bitter fancy lo what befell he threw his eye aside and mark what object did present itself under an oak whose boughs were mossd with age and high top bald with dry antiquity a wretched ragged man oergrown with hair lay sleeping on his back about his neck a green and gilded snake had wreathd itself who with her head nimble in threats approachd the opening of his mouth but suddenly seeing orlando it unlinkd itself and with indented glides did slip away into a bush under which bushs shade a lioness with udders all drawn dry lay couching head on ground with catlike watch when that the sleeping man should stir for tis the royal disposition of that beast to prey on nothing that doth seem as dead this seen orlando did approach the man and found it was his brother his elder brother celia o i have heard him speak of that same brother and he did render him the most unnatural that livd amongst men oliver and well he might so do for well i know he was unnatural rosalind but to orlando did he leave him there food to the suckd and hungry lioness oliver twice did he turn his back and purposd so but kindness nobler ever than revenge and nature stronger than his just occasion made him give battle to the lioness who quickly fell before him in which hurtling from miserable slumber i awakd celia are you his brother rosalind wast you he rescud celia wast you that did so oft contrive to kill him oliver twas i but tis not i i do not shame to tell you what i was since my conversion so sweetly tastes being the thing i am rosalind but for the bloody napkin oliver by and by

now he fainted and cried in fainting upon rosalind brief i recoverd him bound up his wound and after some small space being strong at heart he sent me hither stranger as i am to tell this story that you might excuse his broken promise and to give this napkin dyd in his blood unto the shepherd youth that he in sport doth call his rosalind rosalind swoons celia why how now ganymede sweet ganymede

born and wed unto a woman happy but for me and by me had not our hap been bad with her i livd in joy our wealth increasd by prosperous voyages i often made to epidamnum till my factors death and the great care of goods at random left drew me from kind embracements of my spouse from whom my absence was not six months old before herself almost at fainting under the pleasing punishment that women bear had made provision for her following me and soon and safe arrived where i was there had she not been long but she became a joyful mother of two goodly sons and which was strange the one so like the other as could not be disdnguishd but by names that very hour and in the selfsame inn a mean woman was delivered of such a burden male twins both alike those for their parents were exceeding poor i bought and brought up to attend my sons my wife not meanly proud of two such boys made daily motions for our home return unwilling i agreed alas too soon we came aboard a league from epidamnum had we saild before the alwayswindobeying deep gave any tragic instance of our harm but longer did we not retain much hope for what obscured light the heavens did grant did but convey unto our fearful minds a doubtful warrant of immediate death which though myself would gladly have embracd yet the incessant weepings of my wife weeping before for what she saw must come and piteous plainings of the pretty babes that mournd for fashion ignorant what to fear forcd me to seek delays for them and me and this it was for other means was none the sailors sought for safety by our boat and left the ship

two ships from far making amain to us of corinth that of epidaurus this but ere they cameo let me say no more gather the sequel by that went before duke nay forward old man do not break off so for we may pity though not pardon thee aegeon o had the gods done so i had not now worthily termd them merciless to us for ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues we were encountred by a mighty rock which being violently borne upon our helpful ship was splitted in the midst so that in this unjust divorce of us fortune had left to both of us alike what to delight in what to sorrow for her part poor soul seeming as burdened with lesser weight but not with lesser woe was carried with more speed before the wind and in our sight they three were taken up by fishermen of corinth as we thought at length another ship had seizd on us and knowing whom it was their hap to save gave healthful welcome to their shipwreckd guests and would have reft the fishers of their prey had not their bark been very slow of sail and therefore homeward did they bend their course thus have you heard me severd from my bliss that by misfortunes was my life prolongd to tell sad stories of my own mishaps duke and

oerlookd the letter it were a shame to call her back again and pray her to a fault for which i chid her what fool is she that knows i am a maid and would not force the letter to my view since maids in modesty say no to that which they would have the profferer construe ay fie fie how wayward is this foolish love that like a testy babe will scratch the nurse and presently all humbled kiss the rod how churlishly i chid lucetta hence when willingly i would have had her here how angerly i taught my brow to frown when inward joy enforcd my heart to smile my penance is to call lucetta back and ask

thurio proteus the best way is to slander valentine with falsehood cowardice and poor descent three things that women highly hold in hate duke ay but shell think that it is spoke in hate proteus ay if his enemy deliver it therefore it must with circumstance be spoken by one whom she esteemeth as his friend duke then you must undertake to slander him proteus and that my lord i shall be loath to do tis an ill office for a gentleman especially against his very friend duke where your good word cannot advantage him your slander never can endamage him therefore the office is indifferent being entreated to it by your friend proteus you have prevaild my lord if i can do it by aught that i can speak in his dispraise she shall not long continue love to him but say this weed her love from valentine it follows not that she will love sir thurio thurio therefore as you unwind her love from him lest it should ravel and be good to none you must provide to bottom it on me which must be done by praising me as much as you in worth dispraise sir valentine duke and proteus we dare trust you in this kind because we know on valentines report you are already loves firm votary and cannot soon revolt and change your mind upon this warrant shall you have access where you with silvia may confer at large for she is lumpish heavy melancholy and for your friends sake will be glad of you where you may temper her by your persuasion to hate young valentine and love my friend proteus as much as i can do i will effect but you sir thurio are not sharp enough you must lay lime to tangle her desires by wailful sonnets whose composed rhymes should be fullfraught with serviceable vows duke ay much is the force of heavenbred poesy proteus say that upon the altar of her beauty you sacrifice your tears your sighs your heart write till your ink be dry and with your tears moist it again and frame some feeling line that may discover such integrity for orpheus lute was strung with poets

th eleventh year of the last kings reign was like and had indeed against us passd but that the scambling and unquiet time did push it out of farther question ely but how my lord shall we resist it now canterbury it must be thought on if it pass against us we lose the better half of our possession for all the temporal lands which men devout by testament have given to the church would they strip from us being valud thus as much as would maintain to the kings honour full fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights six thousand and two hundred good esquires and to relief of lazars and weak age of indigent faint souls past corporal toil a hundred almshouses right well supplied and to the coffers of the king beside a thousand pounds by th year thus runs the bill ely this would drink deep canterbury t would drink the cup and all ely but what prevention canterbury the king is full of grace and fair regard ely and a true lover of the holy church canterbury the courses of his youth promisd it not the breath no sooner left his fathers body but that his wildness mortified in him seemd to die too yea at that very moment consideration like an angel came and whippd th offending adam out of him leaving his body as a paradise tenvelop and contain celestial spirits never was such a sudden scholar made never came reformation in a flood with such a heady currance scouring faults nor never hydraheaded wilfulnes so soon did lose his seat and all at once as in this king ely we are blessed in the change canterbury hear him but reason in divinity and alladmiring with an inward wish you would desire the king were made a prelate hear him debate of commonwealth affairs you would say it hath been all in all his study list his discourse of war and you shall hear a fearful battle rendred you in music turn him to any cause of policy the gordian knot of it he will unloose familiar as his garter that when he speaks the air a charterd libertine is still and the mute wonder lurketh in mens ears to steal his sweet and honeyd sentences so that the art and practic part of life must be the mistress to this theoric which is a wonder how his grace should glean it since his addiction was to courses vain his companies unletterd rude and shallow his hours filld up with riots banquets sports and never noted in him any study any retirement any sequestration from open haunts and popularity ely the strawberry grows underneath the nettle and wholesome berries thrive and ripen best neighbourd by fruit of baser quality and so the prince obscurd his contemplation under the veil of wildness which no doubt grew like the summer grass fastest by night unseen yet crescive in his faculty canterbury it must be so for miracles are ceasd and therefore we must needs admit the means how things are perfected ely but my good lord how now for mitigation of this bill urgd by the commons doth his majesty incline to it or no canterbury he seems indifferent or rather swaying more upon our part than cherishing th exhibiters against us for i have made an offer to his majesty upon our spiritual convocation and in regard of causes now in hand which i have opend to his grace at large as touching france to give a greater sum than ever at one time the clergy yet did to his predecessors part withal ely how did this offer seem receivd my lord canterbury with good acceptance of his majesty save that there was not time enough to hear as i perceivd his grace would fain have done the severals and unhidden passages of his true tides to some certain dukedoms and generally to the crown and seat of france derivd from edward his greatgrandfather ely what was th impediment that broke this off canterbury the french ambassador upon that instant cravd audience and the hour i think is come to give him hearing is it four oclock ely it is canterbury then go we in to know his embassy which i could with a ready guess declare before the frenchman speak a word of it ely ill wait upon

him of some things of weight that task our thoughts concerning us and france enter the archbishop of canterbury and the bishop of ely canterbury god and his angels guard your sacred throne and make you long become it king henry sure we thank you my learned lord we pray you to proceed and justly and religiously unfold why the law salique that they have in france or should or should not bar us in our claim and god forbid my dear and faithful lord that you should fashion wrest or bow your reading or nicely charge your understanding soul with opening titles miscreate whose right suits not in native colours with the truth for god doth know how many now in health shall drop their blood in approbation of what your reverence shall incite us to therefore take heed how you impawn our person how you awake our sleeping sword of war we charge you in the name of god take heed for never two such kingdoms did contend without much fall of blood whose guiltless drops are every one a woe a sore complaint gainst him whose wrongs gives edge unto the swords that makes such waste in brief mortality under this conjuration speak my lord for we will hear note and believe in heart that what you speak is in your conscience washd as pure as sin with baptism canterbury then hear me gracious sovereign and you peers that owe yourselves your lives and services to this imperial throne there is no bar to make against your highness claim to france but this which they produce from pharamond in terram salicam mulieres ne succedant no woman shall succeed in salique land which salique land the french unjustly gloze to be the realm of france and pharamond the founder of this law and female bar yet their own authors faithfully affirm that the land salique is in germany between the floods of sala and of elbe where charles the great having subdud the saxons there left behind and settled certain french who holding in disdain the german women for some dishonest manners of their life establishd then this law to wit no female should be inheritrix in salique land which salique as i said twixt elbe and sala is at this day in germany calld meisen then doth it well appear the salique law was not devised for the realm of france nor did the french possess the salique land until four hundred one and twenty years after defunction of king pharamond idly supposd the founder of this law who died within the year of our redemption four hundred twentysix and charles the great subdud the saxons and did seat the french beyond the river sala in the year eight hundred five besides their writers say king pepin which deposed childeric did as heir general being descended of blithild which was daughter to king clothair make claim and title to the crown of france hugh capet also who usurpd the crown of charles the duke of lorraine sole heir male of the true line and stock of charles the great to find his title with some shows of truth though in pure truth it was corrupt and naught conveyd himself as th heir to th lady lingare daughter to charlemain who was the son to lewis the emperor and lewis the son of charles the great also king lewis the tenth who was sole heir to the usurper capet could not keep quiet in his conscience wearing the crown of france till satisfied that fair queen isabel his grandmother was lineal of the lady ermengare daughter to charles the foresaid duke of lorraine by the which marriage the line of charles the great was reunited to the crown of france so that as clear as is the summers sun king pepins title and hugh capets claim king lewis his satisfaction all appear to hold in right and tide of the female so do the kings of france unto this day howbeit they would hold up this salique law to bar your highness claiming from the female and rather choose to hide them in a net than amply to imbar their crooked tides usurpd from you and your progenitors king henry may i with right and conscience make this claim canterbury the sin upon my head dread sovereign for in the book of numbers is it writ when the man dies let the inheritance descend unto the daughter gracious lord stand for your own unwind your bloody flag look back into your mighty ancestors go my dread lord to your greatgrandsires tomb from whom you claim invoke his warlike spirit and your greatuncles edward the black prince who on the french ground playd a tragedy making defeat on the fun power of france whiles his most mighty father on a hill stood smiling to behold his lions whelp forage in blood of french nobility o noble english that could entertain with half their forces the full pride of france and let another half stand laughing by all out of work and cold for action ely awake remembrance of these valiant dead and with your puissant arm renew their feats you are their heir you sit upon their throne the blood and courage that renowned them runs in your veins and my thricepuissant liege is in the very maymorn of his youth ripe for exploits and mighty enterprises exeter your brother kings and monarchs of the earth do all expect that you should rouse yourself as did the former lions of your blood westmoreland they know your grace hath cause and means and might so hath your highness never king of england had nobles richer and more loyal subjects whose hearts have left their bodies here in england and lie paviliond in the fields of france canterbury o let their bodies follow my dear liege with blood and sword and fire to win your right in aid whereof we of the spiritualty will raise your highness such a mighty sum as never did the clergy at one time bring in to any of your ancestors king henry we must not only arm t invade the french but lay down our proportions to defend against the scot who will make road upon us with all advantages canterbury they of those marches gracious sovereign shall be a wall sufficient to defend our inland from the pilfering borderers king henry we do not mean the coursing snatchers only but fear the main intendment of the scot who hath been still a giddy neighbour to us for you shall read that my greatgrandfather never went with his forces into france but that the scot on his unfurnishd kingdom came pouring like the tide into a breach with ample and brim fulness of his force galling the gleaned land with hot assays girdling with grievous siege castles and towns that england being empty of defence hath shook and trembled at th ill neighbourhood canterbury she hath been then more feard than harmd my liege for hear her but exampled by herself when all her chivalry hath been in france and she a mourning widow of her nobles she hath herself not only well defended but taken and impounded as a stray the king of scots whom she did send to france to fill king edwards fame with prisoner kings and make her chronicle as rich with praise as is the ooze and bottom of the sea with sunken wreck and sumless treasuries westmoreland but theres a saying very old and true if that you will france win then with scotland first begin for once the eagle england being in prey to her unguarded nest the weasel scot comes sneaking and so sucks her princely eggs playing the mouse in absence of the cat to tear and havoc more than she can eat exeter it follows then the cat must stay at home yet that is but a crushd necessity since we have locks to safeguard necessaries and pretty traps to catch the petty thieves while that the armed hand doth fight abroad th advised head defends itself at home for government though high and low and lower put into parts doth keep in one consent congreeing in a full and natural close like music canterbury therefore doth heaven divide the state of man in divers functions setting endeavour in continual motion to which is fixed as an aim or but obedience for so work the honey bees creatures that by a rule in nature teach the act of order to a peopled kingdom they have a king and officers of sorts where some like magistrates correct at home others like merchants venture trade abroad others like soldiers armed in their stings make boot upon the summers velvet buds which pillage they with merry march bring home to the tentroyal of their emperor who busied in his majesty surveys the singing masons building roofs of gold the civil citizens kneading up the honey the poor mechanic porters crowding in their heavy burdens at his narrow gate the sadeyd justice with his surly hum delivering oer to executors pale the lazy yawning drone i this infer that many things having full reference to one consent may work contrariously as many arrows loosed several ways come to one mark as many ways meet in one town as many fresh streams meet in one salt sea as many lines close in the dials centre so many a thousand actions once afoot end in one purpose and be all well home without defeat therefore to france my liege divide your happy england into four whereof take you one quarter into france and you withal shall make all gallia shake if we with thrice such powers left at home cannot defend our own doors from the dog let us be worried and our nation lose the name of hardiness and policy king henry call in the messengers sent from the dauphin exeunt some attendants now are we well resolvd and by gods help and yours the noble sinews of our power france being ours well bend it to our awe or break it all to pieces or there well sit ruling in large and ample empery oer france and all her almost kingly dukedoms or lay these bones in an unworthy urn tombless with no remembrance over them either our history shall with full mouth speak freely of our acts or else our grave like turkish mute shall have a tongueless mouth not worshippd with a waxen epitaph enter ambassadors of france now are we well prepard to know the pleasure of our fair cousin dauphin for we hear your greeting is from him not from the king ambassador mayt please your majesty to give us leave freely to render what we have in charge or shall we sparingly show you far of the dauphins meaning and our embassy king henry we are no tyrant but a christian king unto whose grace our passion is as subject as are our wretches fettred in our prisons therefore with frank and with uncurbed plainness tell us the dauphins mind ambassador thus then in few your highness lately sending into france did claim some certain dukedoms in the right of your great predecessor king edward the third in answer of which claim the prince our master says that you savour too much of your youth and bids you be advisd theres nought in france that can be with a nimble galliard won you cannot revel into dukedoms there he therefore sends you meeter for your spirit this tun of treasure and in lieu of this desires you let the dukedoms that you claim hear no more of you this the dauphin speaks king henry what treasure uncle exeter tennisballs my liege king henry we are glad the dauphin is so pleasant with us his present and your pains we thank you for when we have matchd our rackets to these balls we will in france by gods grace play a set shall strike his fathers crown into the hazard tell him he hath made a match with such a wrangler that all the courts of france will be disturbd with chaces and we understand him well how he comes oer us with our wilder days not measuring what use we made of them we never valud this poor seat of england and therefore living hence did give ourself to barbarous licence as tis ever common that men are merriest when they are from home but tell the dauphin i will keep my state be like a king and show my sail of greatness when i do rouse me in my throne of france for that i have laid by my majesty and plodded like a man for workingdays but i will rise there with so full a glory that i will dazzle all the eyes of france yea strike the dauphin blind to look on us and tell the pleasant prince this mock of his hath turnd his balls to gunstones and his soul shall stand sore charged for the wasteful vengeance that shall fly with them for many a thousand widows shall this his mock mock of their dear husbands mock mothers from their sons mock castles down and some are yet ungotten and unborn that shall have cause to curse the dauphins scorn but this lies all within the will of god to whom i do appeal and in whose name tell you the dauphin i am coming on to venge me as i may and to put forth my rightful hand in a wellhallowd cause so get you hence in peace and tell the dauphin his jest will savour but of shallow wit when thousands weep more than did laugh at it convey them with safe conduct fare you well exeunt ambassadors exeter this was a merry message king henry we hope to make the sender blush at it therefore my lords omit no happy hour that may give furthrance to our expedition for we have now no thought in us but france save those to god that run before our business therefore let our proportions for these wars be soon collected and all things thought upon that may with reasonable swiftness ad more feathers to our wings for god before well chide this dauphin at his fathers door therefore let every man now task his thought that this fair action may on foot be brought exeunt act ii prologue flourish enter chorus chorus now all the youth of england are on fire and silken dalliance in the wardrobe lies now thrive the armourers and honours thought reigns solely in the breast of every man they sell the pasture now to buy the horse following the mirror of all christian kings with winged heels as english mercuries for now sits expectation in the air and hides a sword from hilts

policy seek to divert the english purposes o england model to thy inward greatness like little body with a mighty heart what mightst thou do that honour would thee do were all thy children kind and natural but see thy fault france hath in thee found out a nest of hollow bosoms which he fills with treacherous crowns and three corrupted men one richard earl of cambridge and the second henry lord scroop of masham and the third sir thomas grey knight of northumberland have for the gilt of france o guilt indeed confirmd conspiracy with fearful france and by their hands this grace of kings must

coind me into gold wouldst thou have practisd on me for thy use may it be possible that foreign hire could out of thee extract one spark of evil that might annoy my finger tis so strange that though the truth of it stands off as gross as black and white my eye will scarcely see it treason and murder ever kept together as two yokedevils sworn to eithers purpose working so grossly in a natural cause that admiration did not whoop at them but thou gainst all proportion didst bring in wonder to wait on treason and on murder and whatsoever cunning fiend it was that wrought upon thee so preposterously hath got the voice in hell for excellence and other devils that suggest by treasons do botch and bungle up damnation with patches colours and with forms being fetchd from glistring semblances of piety but he that temperd thee bade thee stand up gave thee no instance why thou shouldst do treason unless to dub thee with the name of traitor if that same demon that hath gulld thee thus should with his lion gait walk the whole world he might return to vasty tartar back and tell the legions i can never win a soul so easy as that englishmans o how hast thou with jealousy infected the sweetness of affiance show men dutiful why so didst thou seem they grave and learned why so didst thou come they of noble family why so didst thou seem they religious why so didst thou or are they spare in diet free from gross passion or of mirth or anger constant in spirit not swerving with the blood garnishd and deckd in modest complement not working with the eye without the ear and but in

treason by the name of richard earl of cambridge i arrest thee of high treason by the name of henry lord scroop of masham i arrest thee of high treason by the name of thomas grey knight of northumberland scroop our purposes god justly hath discoverd and i repent my fault more than my death which i beseech your highness to forgive although my body pay the price of it cambridge for me the gold of france did not seduce although i did admit it as a motive the sooner to effect what i intended but god be thanked for prevention which i in sufferance heartily will rejoice beseeching god and you to pardon me grey never did faithful subject more rejoice at the discovery of most dangerous treason than i do at this hour joy oer myself prevented from a damned enterprise my fault but not my body pardon sovereign king henry god quit you in his mercy hear your sentence you have conspird against our royal person joind with an enemy proclaimd and from his coffers receivd the golden earnest

that island of england breeds very valiant creatures their mastiffs are of unmatchable courage orleans foolish curs that run winking into the mouth of a russian bear and have their heads crushd like rotten apples you may as well say thats a valiant flea that dare eat his breakfast on the lip of a lion constable just just and the men do sympathise with the mastiffs in robustious and rough coming

each a hundred englishmen exeunt act iv prologue enter chorus chorus now entertain conjecture of a time when creeping murmur and the poring dark fills the wide vessel of the universe from camp to camp through the foul womb of night the hum of either army stilly sounds that the fixd sentinels almost receive the secret whispers of each others watch fire answers fire and through their paly flames each battle sees the others umberd face steed threatens steed in high and boastful neighs piercing the nights dull ear and from the tents the armourers accomplishing the knights with busy hammers closing rivets up give dreadful note of preparation the country cocks do crow the clocks do ton and the third hour of drowsy morning name proud of their numbers and secure in soul the confident and overlusty french do the lowrated english play at dice and chide the cripple tardygaited night who like a foul and ugly witch doth limp so tediously away the poor condemned english like sacrifices by their watchful fires sit patiently and inly ruminate the mornings danger and their gesture sad investing lanklean cheeks and warworn coats presenteth them unto the gazing moon so many horrid ghosts o now who will behold the royal captain of this ruind band walking from watch to watch from tent to tent let him cry praise and glory on his head for forth he goes and visits all his host bids them good morrow with a modest smile and calls them brothers friends and countrymen upon his royal face there is no note how dread an army hath enrounded him nor doth he dedicate one jot of colour unto the weary and allwatched night but freshly looks and overbears attaint with cheerful semblance and sweet majesty that every wretch pining and pale before beholding him plucks comfort from his looks a largess universal like the sun his liberal eye doth give to every one thawing cold fear that mean and gentle all behold as may unworthiness define a little touch of harry in the night and so our scene must to the battle fly where o for pity we shall much disgrace with four or five most vile and ragged foils right illdisposd in brawl ridiculous the name of agincourt yet sit and see minding true things by what their mockries be exit scene i france the english camp at agincourt enter the king bedford and gloucester king henry gloucester tis true that we are in great danger the greater

there is no tiddletaddle nor pibblepabble in pompeys camp i warrant you you shall find the ceremonies of the wars and the cares of it and the forms of it and the sobriety of it and the modesty of it to be otherwise gower why the enemy is loud you hear him all night fluellen if the enemy is an ass and a fool and a prating coxcomb is it meet think you that we should also look you be an ass and a fool and a prating coxcomb in your own conscience now gower i will speak lower fluellen i pray you and beseech you that you will exeunt gower and fluellen king henry though it appear a little out of fashion there is much care and valour in this welshman enter three soldiers john bates alexander court and michael williams court brother john bates is not that the morning which breaks yonder bates i think it be but we have no great cause to desire the approach of day williams we see yonder the beginning of the day but i think we shall never see the end of it who goes there king henry a friend williams under what captain serve you king henry under sir thomas erpingham williams a good old commander and a most kind gentleman i pray you what thinks he of our estate king henry even as men wreckd upon a sand that look to be washd off the next tide bates he hath not told his thought to the king king henry no nor it is not meet he should for though i speak it to you i think the king is but a man as i am the violet smells to him as it doth to me the element shows to him as it doth to me all his senses have but human conditions his ceremonies laid by in his nakedness he appears but a man and though his affections are higher mounted than ours yet when they stoop they stoop with the like wing therefore when he sees reason of fears as we do his fears out of doubt be of the same relish as ours are yet in reason no man should possess him with any appearance of fear lest he by showing it should dishearten his army bates he may show what outward courage he will but i believe as cold a night as tis he could wish himself in thames up to the neck and so i would he were and i by him at all adventures so we were quit here king henry by my troth i will speak my conscience of the king i think he would not wish himself anywhere but where he is bates then i would he were here alone so should he be sure to be ransomed and a many poor mens lives saved king henry i dare say you love him not so ill to wish him here alone howsoever you speak this to feel other mens minds methinks i could not die anywhere so contented as in the kings company his cause being just and his quarrel honourable williams thats more than we know bates ay or more than we should seek after for we know enough if we know we are the kings subjects if his cause be wrong our obedience to the king wipes the crime of it out of us williams but if the cause be not good the king himself hath a heavy reckoning to make when all those legs and arms and heads choppd off in a battle shall join together at the latter day and cry all we died at such a place some swearing some crying for a surgeon some upon their wives left poor behind them some upon the debts they owe some upon their children rawly left i am afeard there are few die well that die in a battle for how can they charitably dispose of anything when blood is their argument now if these men do not die well it will be a black matter for the king that led them to it who to disobey were against all proportion of subjection king henry so if a son that is by his father sent about merchandise do sinfully miscarry upon the sea the imputation of his wickedness by your rule should be imposed upon his father that sent him or if a servant under his masters command transporting a sum of money be assailed by robbers and die in many irreconcild iniquities you may call the business of the master the author of the servants damnation but this is not so the king is not bound to answer the particular endings of his soldiers the father of his son nor the master of his servant for they purpose not their death when they purpose their services besides there is no king be his cause never so spotless if it come to the arbitrement of swords can try it out with all unspotted soldiers some peradventure have on them the guilt of premeditated and contrived murder some of beguiling virgins with the broken seals of perjury some making the wars their bulwark that have before gored the gentle bosom of peace with pillage and robbery now if these men have defeated the law and outrun native punishment though they can outstrip men they have no wings to fly from god war is his beadle war is his vengeance so that here men are punishd for beforebreach of the kings laws in now the kings quarrel where they feared the death they have borne life away and where they would be safe they perish then if they die unprovided no more is the king guilty of their damnation than he was before guilty of those impieties for the which they are now visited every subjects duty is the kings but every subjects soul is his own therefore should every soldier in the wars do as every sick man in his bed wash every mote out of his conscience and dying so death is to him advantage or not dying the time was blessedly lost wherein such preparation was gained and in him that escapes it were not sin to think that making god so free an offer he let him outlive that day to see his greatness and to teach others how they should prepare williams tis certain every man that dies ill the ill upon his own head the king is not to answer for it bates i do not desire he should answer for me and yet i determine to fight lustily for him king henry i myself heard the king say he would not be ransomd williams ay he said so to make us fight cheerfully but when our throats are cut he may be ransomd and we neer the wiser king henry if i live to see it i will never trust his word after williams you pay him then thats a perilous shot out of an eldergun that a poor and a private displeasure can do against a monarch you may as well go about to turn the sun to ice with fanning in his face with a peacocks feather youll never trust his word after come tis a foolish saying king henry your reproof is something too round i should be angry with you if the time were convenient williams let it be a quarrel between us if you live king henry i embrace it williams how shall i know thee again king henry give me any gage of thine and i will wear it in my bonnet then if ever thou darst acknowledge it i will make it my quarrel williams heres my glove give me another of thine king henry there williams this will i also wear in my cap if ever thou come to me and say after tomorrow this is my glove by this hand i will take thee a box on the ear king henry if ever i live to see it i will challenge it williams thou darst as well be hangd king henry well i will do it though i take thee in the kings company williams keep thy word fare thee well bates be friends you english fools be friends we have french quarrels enow if you could tell how to reckon king henry indeed the french may lay twenty french crowns to one they will beat us for they bear them on their shoulders but it is no english treason to cut french crowns and tomorrow the king himself will be a clipper exeunt soldiers upon the king let us our lives our souls our debts our careful wives our children and our sins lay on the king we must bear all o hard condition twinborn with greatness subject to the breath of every fool whose sense no more can feel but his own wringing what infinite hearts ease must

creating awe and fear in other men wherein thou art less happy being feard than they in fearing what drinkst thou oft instead of homage sweet but poisond flattery o be sick great greatness and bid thy ceremony give thee cure thinks thou the fiery fever will go out with titles blown from adulation will it give place to flexure and low bending canst thou when thou commandst the beggars knee command the health of it no thou proud dream that playst so subtly with a kings repose i am a king that find thee and i know tis not the balm the sceptre and the ball the sword the mace the crown imperial the intertissued robe of gold and pearl the farced tide running fore the king the throne he sits on nor the tide of pomp that beats upon the high shore of this world no not all these thrice gorgeous ceremony not all these laid in bed majestical can sleep so soundly as the wretched slave who with a body filld and vacant mind gets him to rest crammd with distressful bread never sees horrid night the child of hell but like a lackey from the rise to set sweats in the eye of pheebus and all night sleeps in elysium next day after dawn doth rise and help hyperion to his horse and follows so the everrunning year with profitable labour to his grave and but for ceremony such a wretch winding up days with toil and nights with sleep had the forehand and vantage of a king the slave a member of the

the scythe all uncorrected rank conceives by idleness and nothing teems but hateful docks rough thistles kecksies burs losing both beauty and utility and as our vineyards fallows meads and hedges defective in their natures grow to wildness even so our houses and ourselves and children have lost or do not learn for want of time the sciences that should become our country but grow like savages

me to verses or to dance for your sake kate why you undid me for the one i have neither words nor measure and for the other i have no strength in measure yet a reasonable measure in strength if i could win a lady at leapfrog or by vaulting into my saddle with my armour on my back under the correction of bragging be it spoken i should quickly leap into wife or if i might buffet for my love or bound my horse for her favours i could lay on like a butcher and sit like a jackanapes never off but before god kate i cannot look greenly nor gasp out my cloquence nor i have no cunning in protestation only downright oaths which i never use till urgd nor never break for urging if thou canst love a fellow of this temper kate whose face is not worth sunburning that never looks in his glass for love of anything he sees there let thine eye be thy cook i speak to thee plain soldier if thou canst love me for this take me if not to say to thee that i shall die is true but for thy love by the lord no yet i love thee too and while thou livst dear kate take a fellow of plain and uncoined constancy for he perforce must do thee right because he hath not the gift to woo in other places

fall a straight back will stoop a black beard will turn white a curld pate will grow bald a fair face will wither a full eye will wax hollow but a good heart kate is the sun and the moon or rather the

satisfied poor gentleman his wrong doth equal mine since henry monmouth first began to reign before whose glory i was great in arms this loathsome sequestration have i had and even since then hath richard been obscurd deprivd of honour and inheritance but now the arbitrator of despairs just death kind umpire of mens miseries with sweet enlargement doth dismiss me hence i would his troubles likewise were expird that so he might recover what was lost enter richard plantagenet first keeper my lord your loving nephew now is come mortimer richard plantagenet my friend is he come plantagenet

father earl of cambridge lost his head mortimer that cause fair nephew that imprisond me and hath detaind me all my flowring youth within a loathsome dungeon there to pine was cursed instrument of his decease plantagenet discover more at large what cause that was for i am ignorant and cannot guess mortimer i will if that my fading breath permit and death approach not ere my tale be done henry the fourth grandfather to this king deposd his nephew richard edwards son the firstbegotten and the lawful heir of edward king the third of that descent during whose reign the percies of the north finding his usurpation most unjust endeavourd my advancement to the throne the reason movd these warlike lords to this was for thatyoung richard thus removd leaving no heir begotten of his body i was the next by birth and parentage for by my mother i derived am from lionel duke of clarence third son to king edward the third whereas he from john of gaunt doth bring his pedigree being but fourth of that heroic line but mark as in this haughty great attempt they laboured to plant the rightful heir i lost my liberty and they their lives long after this when henry the fifth succeeding his father bolingbroke did reign thy father earl of cambridge then derivd from famous edmund langley duke of york marrying my sister that thy mother was again in pity of my hard distress levied an army weening to redeem and have installd me in the diadem but as the rest so fell that noble earl and was beheaded thus the mortimers in whom the title rested were suppressd plantagenet of which my lord your honour is the last mortimer true and thou seest that i no issue have and that my fainting words do warrant death thou art my heir the rest i wish thee gather but yet be wary in thy studious care plantagenet thy grave admonishments prevail with me but yet methinks my fathers execution was nothing less than bloody tyranny mortimer with silence nephew be thou politic strong fixed is the house of lancaster and like a mountain not to be removd but now thy uncle is removing hence as princes do their courts when they are cloyd with long continuance in a settled place plantagenet o uncle would some part of my young years might but redeem the passage of your age mortimer thou dost then wrong me as that slaughterer doth which giveth many wounds when one will kill mourn not except thou sorrow for my good only give order for my funeral and so farewell and fair be all thy hopes and prosperous be thy life in peace and war dies plantagenet and peace no war befall thy parting soul in prison hast thou spent a pilgrimage and like a hermit overpassd thy days well i will lock his counsel in my breast and what i do imagine let that rest keepers convey him hence and i myself will see his burial better than his life exeunt gaolers hearing out the body of mortimer here dies the dusky torch of mortimer chokd with ambition of the meaner sort and for those wrongs those bitter injuries

and the aspiring french and here at hand the dauphin and his train approacheth to confer about some matter york is all our travail turnd to this effect after the slaughter of so many peers so many captains gentlemen and soldiers that in this quarrel have been overthrown and sold their bodies for their countrys benefit shall we at last conclude effeminate peace have we not lost most part of all the towns by treason falsehood and by treachery our great progenitors had conquered o warwick warwick i foresee with grief the utter loss of all the realm of france warwick be patient york if we conclude a peace it shall be with such strict and severe covenants as little shall the frenchmen gain thereby enter charles alencon bastard reignier and others charles since lords of england it is thus agreed that peaceful truce shall be proclaimd in france we come to be informed by yourselves what the conditions of that league must be york speak winchester for boiling choler chokes the hollow passage of my poisond voice by sight of these our baleful enemies cardinal charles and the rest it is enacted thus that in regard king henry gives consent of mere compassion and of lenity to ease your country of distressful war an suffer you to breathe in fruitful peace you shall become true liegemen to his crown and charles upon condition thou wilt swear to pay him tribute and submit thyself thou shalt be placd as viceroy under him and still enjoy thy regal dignity alencon must he be then as shadow of himself adorn his temples with a coronet and yet in substance and authority retain but privilege of a private man this proffer is absurd and reasonless charles tis known already that i am possessd with more than half the gallian territories and therein reverencd for their lawful king shall i for lucre of the rest unvanquishd detract so much from that prerogative as to be calld but viceroy of the whole no lord ambassador ill rather keep that which i have than coveting for more be cast from possibility of all york insulting charles hast thou by secret means usd intercession to obtain a league and now the matter grows to compromise standst thou aloof upon comparison either accept the title thou usurpst of benefit proceeding from our king and not of any challenge of desert or we will plague thee with incessant wars reignier to charles my lord you do not well in obstinacy to cavil in the course of this contract if once it be neglected ten to one we shall not find like opportunity alencon to charles to say the truth it is your policy to save your subjects from such massacre and ruthless slaughters as are daily seen by our proceeding in hostility and therefore take this compact of a truce although you break it when your pleasure serves warwick how sayst thou charles shall our condition stand charles it shall only reservd you claim no interest in any of our towns of garrison york then swear allegiance to his majesty as thou art knight never to disobey nor be rebellious to the crown of england thou nor thy nobles to the crown of england charles and the rest give tokens of fealty so now dismiss your army when ye please hang up your ensigns let your drums be still for here we entertain a solemn peace exeunt scene london the palace enter suffolk in conference with the king gloucester and exeter king henry your wondrous rare description noble earl of beauteous margaret hath astonishd me her virtues graced with external gifts do breed loves settled passions in my heart and like as rigour of tempestuous gusts provokes the mightiest hulk against the tide so am i driven by breath of her renown either to suffer shipwreck or arrive where i may have fruition of her love suffolk tush my good lord this superficial tale is but a preface of her worthy praise the chief perfections of that lovely dame had i sufficient skill to utter them would make a volume of enticing lines able to ravish any dull conceit and which is more she is not so divine so fullreplete with choice of all delights but with as humble lowliness of mind she is content to be at your command command i mean of virtuous intents to love and honour henry as her lord king henry and otherwise will henry neer presume therefore my lord protector give consent that margaret may be englands royal queen gloucester so should i give consent to flatter sin you know my lord your highness is betrothd unto another lady of esteem how shall we then dispense with that contract and not deface your honour with reproach suffolk as doth a ruler with unlawful oaths or one that at a triumph having vowd to try his strength forsaketh yet the lists by reason of his adversarys odds a poor earls daughter is unequal odds and therefore may be broke without offence gloucester why what i pray is margaret more than that her father is no better than an earl although in glorious titles he excel suffolk yes my lord her father is a king the king of naples and jerusalem and of such great authority in france as his alliance will confirm our peace and keep the frenchmen in allegiance gloucester and so the earl of armagnac may do because he is near kinsman unto charles exeter beside his wealth doth warrant a liberal dower where reignier sooner will receive than give suffolk a dowr my lords disgrace not so your king that he should be so abject base and poor to choose for wealth and not for perfect love henry is able to enrich his queen and not to seek a queen to make him rich so worthless peasants bargain for their wives as marketmen for oxen sheep or horse marriage is a matter of more worth than to be dealt in by attorneyship not whom we will but whom his grace affects must be companion of his nuptial bed and therefore lords since he affects her most it most of all these reasons bindeth us in our opinions she should be preferrd for what is wedlock forced but a hell an age of discord and continual strife whereas the contrary bringeth bliss and is a pattern of celestial peace whom should we match with henry being a king but margaret that is daughter to a king her peerless feature joined with her birth approves her fit for none but for a king her valiant courage and undaunted spirit more than in women commonly is seen will answer our hope in issue of a king for henry son unto a conqueror is likely to beget more conquerors if with a lady of so high resolve as is fair margaret he be linkd in love then yield my lords and here conclude with me that margaret shall be queen and none but she king henry whether it be through force of your report my noble lord of suffolk or for that my tender youth was never yet attaint with any passion of inflaming love i cannot tell but this i am assurd i feel such sharp dissension in my breast such fierce alarums both of hope and fear as i am sick with working of my thoughts take therefore shipping post my lord to france agree to any covenants and procure that lady margaret do vouchsafe to come to cross the seas to england and be crownd king henrys faithful and anointed queen for your expenses and sufficient charge among the people gather up a tenth be gone i say for till you do return i rest perplexed with a thousand cares and you good uncle banish all offence if you do censure me by what you were not what you are i know it will excuse this sudden execution of my will and so conduct me where from company i may revolve and ruminate my grief exit gloucester ay grief i fear me both at first and last exeunt gloucester and exeter suffolk thus suffolk hath prevaild and thus he goes as did the youthful paris

france his true inheritance and did my brother bedford toil his wits to keep by policy what henry got have you yourselves somerset buckingham brave york salisbury and victorious warwick receivd deep scars in france and normandy or hath mine uncle beaufort and myself with all the learned council of the realm studied so long sat in the council house early and late debating to and fro how france and frenchmen might be kept in awe and had his highness in his infancy crowned in paris in despite of foes and shall these labours and these honours die shall henrys conquest bedfords vigilance your deeds of war and all our counsel die o peers of england shameful is this league fatal this marriage cancelling your fame blotting your names from books of memory razing the characters of your renown defacing monuments of conquerd france undoing all as all had never been cardinal nephew what means this passionate discourse this peroration with such circumstance for france tis ours and we will keep it still gloucester ay uncle we will keep it if we can but now it is impossible we should suffolk the newmade duke that rules the roast hath given the duchy of anjou and maine unto the poor king reignier whose large style agrees not with the leanness of his purse salisbury now by the death of him that died for all these counties were the keys of normandy but wherefore weeps warwick my valiant

these arms of mine did conquer and are the cities that i got with wounds deliverd up again with peaceful words mort dieu york for suffolks duke may he be suffocate that dims the honour of this warlike isle france should have torn and rent my very heart before i would have yielded to this league i never read but englands kings have had large sums of gold and dowries with their wives and our king henry gives away his own to match with her that brings no vantages gloucester a proper jest and never heard before that suffolk should demand a whole fifteenth for costs and charges in transporting her she should have stayd in france and starvd in france before cardinal my lord of gloucester now ye grow too hot it was the pleasure of my lord the king gloucester my lord of winchester i know your

good duke of gloucester clapping their hands and crying with loud voice jesu maintain your royal excellence with god preserve the good duke humphrey i fear me lords for all this flattering gloss he will be found a dangerous protector buckingham why should he then protect our sovereign he being of age to govern of himself cousin of somerset join you with me and all together with the duke of

pride and greatness of his place be grief to us yet let us watch the haughty cardinal his insolence is more intolerable than all the princes in the land beside if gloucester be displacd hell be protector buckingham or thou or i somerset will be protector despite duke humphrey or the cardinal exeunt buckingham and somerset salisbury pride went before ambition follows him while these do labour for their own preferment behoves it us to labour for the realm i never saw but humphrey duke of gloucester did bear him like a noble gentleman oft have i seen the haughty cardinal more like a soldier than a man o th church as stout and proud as he were lord of all swear like a ruffian and demean himself unlike the ruler of a commonweal warwick my son the comfort of my age thy deeds thy plainness and thy housekeeping hath won the greatest favour of the commons excepting none but good duke humphrey and brother york thy acts in ireland in bringing them to civil discipline thy late exploits done in the heart of france when thou wert regent for our sovereign have made thee feard and honourd of the people join we together for the public good in what we can to bridle and suppress the pride of suffolk and the cardinal with somersets and buckinghams ambition and as we may cherish duke humphreys deeds while they do tend the profit of the land warwick so god help warwick as he loves the land and common profit of his country york and so says york aside for he hath greatest cause salisbury then lets make haste away and look unto the main warwick unto the main o father maine is lost that maine which by main force warwick did win and would have kept so long as breath did last main chance father you meant but i meant maine which i will win from france or else be slain exeunt warwick and salisbury york anjou and maine are given to the french paris is lost the state of normandy stands on a tickle point now they are gone suffolk concluded on the articles the peers agreed and henry was well pleasd to changes two dukedoms for a dukes fair daughter i cannot blame them all what ist to them tis thine they give away and not their own pirates may make cheap pennyworths of their pillage and purchase friends and give to courtezans still revelling like lords till all be gone while as the silly owner of the goods weeps over them and wrings his hapless hands and shakes his head and trembling stands aloof while all is shard and all is borne away ready to starve and dare not touch his own so york must sit and fret and bite his tongue while his own lands are bargaind for and sold methinks the realms of england france and ireland bear that proportion to my flesh and blood as did the fatal brand althaea burnt unto the princes heart of calydon anjou and maine both given unto the french cold news for me for i had hope of france even as i have of fertile englands soil a day will come when york shall claim his own and therefore i will take the nevils parts and make a show of love to proud duke humphrey and when i spy advantage claim the crown for thats the golden mark i seek to hit nor shall proud lancaster usurp my right nor hold the sceptre in his childish fist nor wear the diadem upon his head whose churchlike humours fits not for a crown then york be still awhile till time do serve watch thou and wake when others be asleep to pry into the secrets of the state till henry surfeiting in joys of love with his new bride and englands dearbought queen and humphrey with the peers be falln at jars then will i raise aloft the milkwhite rose with whose sweet smell the air

to englands crown salisbury my lord i long to hear it at full warwick sweet york begin and if thy claim be good the nevils are thy subjects to command york then thus edward the third my lords had seven sons the first edward the black prince prince of wales the second william of hatfield and the third lionel duke of clarence next to whom was john of gaunt the duke of lancaster the fifth was edmund langley duke of york the sixth was thomas of woodstock duke of gloucester william of windsor was the seventh and last edward the black prince died before his father and left behind him richard

realm deposd the rightful king sent his poor queen to france from whence she came and him to pomfret where as all you know harmless richard was murdered traitorously warwick father the duke hath told the truth thus got the house of lancaster the crown york which now they hold by force and not by right for richard the first sons heir being dead the issue of the next son should have reignd salisbury but william of hatfield died without an heir york the third son duke of clarence from whose line i claim the crown had issue philippe a daughter who married edmund mortimer earl of march edmund had issue roger earl of march roger had issue edmund anne and eleanor salisbury this edmund in the reign of bolingbroke as i have read laid claim unto the crown and but for owen glendower had been king

fifth son son by her i claim the kingdom she was heir to roger earl of march who was the son of edmund mortimer who married philippe sole daughter unto lionel duke of clarence so if the issue of the elder son succeed before the younger i am king warwick what plain proceedings is more plain than this henry doth claim the crown from john of gaunt the fourth son york claims it from the third till

suffolk york buckingham salisbury and warwick to the parliament king henry i muse my lord of gloucester is not come tis not his wont to be the hindmost man whateer occasion keeps him from us now queen can you not see or will ye not observe the strangeness of his alterd countenance with what a majesty he bears himself how insolent of late he is become how proud how peremptory and unlike himself we know the time since he was mild and affable and if we did but glance a faroff look immediately he was upon his knee that all the court admird him for submission but meet him now and be it in the morn when every one will give the time of day he knits his brow and shows an angry eye and passeth by with stiff unbowed knee disdaining duty that to us belongs small curs are not regarded when they grin but great men tremble when the lion roars and humphrey is no little man in england first note that he is near you in descent and should you fall he is the next will mount me seemeth then it is no policy respecting what a rancorous mind he bears and his advantage following your decease that he should come about your royal person or be admitted to your highness council by flattery hath he won the commons hearts and when he please to make commotion tis to be feard they all will follow him now tis the spring and weeds are shallowrooted suffer them now and theyll oergrow the garden and choke the herbs for want of husbandry the reverent care i bear unto my lord made me collect these dangers in the duke if it be fond can it a womans fear which fear if better reasons can supplant i will subscribe and say i wrongd the duke my lord of suffolk buckingham and york reprove my allegation if you can or else conclude my words effectual suffolk well hath your highness seen into this duke and had i first been put to speak my mind i think i should have told your graces tale the duchess by his subornation upon my life began her devilish practices or if he were not privy to those faults yet by reputing of his high descent as next the king he was successive heir and such high vaunts of his nobility did instigate the bedlam brainsick duchess by wicked means to frame our sovereigns fall smooth runs the water where the brook is deep and in his simple show he harbours treason the fox barks not when he would steal the lamb no no my sovereign gloucester is a man unsounded yet and full of deep deceit cardinal did he not contrary to form of law devise strange deaths for small offences done york and did he not in his protectorship levy great sums of money through the realm for soldiers pay in france and never sent it by means whereof the towns each day revolted buckingham tut these are petty faults to faults unknown which time will bring to light in smooth duke humphrey king henry my lords at once the care you have of us to mow down thorns that would annoy our foot is worthy praise but shall i speak my conscience our kinsman gloucester is as innocent from meaning treason to our royal person as is the sucking lamb or harmless dove the duke is virtuous mild and too well given to dream on evil or to work my downfall queen ah whats more dangerous than this fond affiance seems he a dove his feathers are but borrowd for hes disposed as the hateful raven is he a lamb his skin is surely lent him for hes inclind as is the ravenous wolf who cannot steal a shape that means deceit take heed my lord the welfare of us all hangs on the cutting short that fraudful man enter somerset somerset all health unto my gracious sovereign king henry welcome lord somerset what news from france somerset that all your interest in those territories is utterly bereft you all is lost king henry cold news lord somerset but gods will be done york aside cold news for me for i had hope of france as firmly as i hope for fertile england thus are my blossoms blasted in the bud and caterpillars eat my leaves away but i will remedy this gear ere long or sell my title for a glorious grave enter gloucester gloucester all happiness unto my lord the king pardon my liege that i have stayd so long suffolk nay gloucester know that thou art come too soon unless thou wert more loyal than thou art i do arrest thee of high treason here gloucester well suffolk thou shalt not see me blush nor change my countenance for this arrest a heart unspotted is not easily daunted the purest spring is not so free from mud as i am clear from treason to my sovereign who can accuse me wherein am i guilty york tis thought my lord that you took bribes of france and being protector stayd the soldiers pay by means whereof his highness hath lost france gloucester is it but thought so what are they that think it i never robbd the soldiers of their pay nor ever had one penny bribe from france so help me god as i have watchd the night ay night by night in studying good for england that doit that eer i wrested from the king or any groat i hoarded to my use be brought against me at my trialday no many a pound of mine own proper store because i would not tax the needy commons have i dispursed to the garrisons and never askd for restitution cardinal it serves you well my lord to say so much gloucester i say no more than truth so help me god york in your protectorship you did devise strange tortures for offenders never heard of that england was defamd by tyranny gloucester why tis well known that whiles i was protector pity was all the fault that was in me for i should melt at an offenders tears and lowly words were ransom for their fault unless it were a bloody murderer or foul felonious thief that fleecd poor passengers i never gave them condign punishment murder indeed that bloody sin i torturd above the felon or what trespass else suffolk my lord these faults are easy quickly answerd but mightier crimes are laid unto your charge whereof you cannot easily purge yourself i do arrest you in his highness name and here commit you to my lord cardinal to keep until your further time of trial king henry my lord of gloucester tis my special hope that you will clear yourself from all suspense my conscience tells me you are innocent gloucester ah gracious lord these days are dangerous virtue is chokd with foul ambition and charity chasd hence by rancours hand foul subornation is predominant and equity exild your highness land i know their complot is to have my life and if my death might make this island happy and prove the period of their tyranny i would expend it with all willingness but mine is made the prologue to their play for thousands more that yet suspect no peril will not conclude their plotted tragedy beauforts red sparkling eyes blab his hearts malice and suffolks cloudy brow his stormy hate sharp buckingham unburdens with his tongue the envious load that lies upon his heart and dogged york that reaches at the moon whose overweening arm i have pluckd back by false accuse doth level at my life and you my sovereign lady with the rest causeless have laid disgraces on my head and with your best endeavour have stirrd up my liefest liege to be mine enemy ay all of you have laid your heads together myself had notice of your conventicles and all to make away my guiltless life i shall not want false witness to condemn me nor store of treasons to augment my guilt the ancient proverb will be well effected a staff is quickly found to beat a dog cardinal my liege his railing is intolerable if those that care to keep your royal person from treasons secret knife and traitors rage be thus upbraided chid and rated at and the offender granted scope of speech twill make them cool in zeal unto your grace suffolk hath he not twit our sovereign lady here with ignominious words though clerkly couchd as if she had suborned some to swear false allegations to oerthrow his state queen but i can give the loser leave to chide gloucester far truer spoke than meant i lose indeed beshrew the winners for they playd me false and well such losers may have leave to speak buckingham hell wrest the sense and hold us here all day lord cardinal he is your prisoner cardinal sirs take away the duke and guard him sure gloucester ah thus king henry throws away his crutch before his legs be firm to bear his body thus is the shepherd beaten from thy side and wolves are gnarling who shall gnaw thee first ah that my fear were false ah that it were for good king henry thy decay i fear exit guarded king henry my lords what to your wisdoms seemeth best do or undo as if ourself were here queen what will your highness leave the parliament king henry ay margaret my heart is drownd with grief whose flood begins to flow within mine eyes my body round engirt with misery for whats more miserable than discontent ah uncle humphrey in thy face i see the map of honour truth and loyalty and yet good humphrey is the hour to come that eer i provd thee false or feard thy faith what louring star now envies thy estate that these great lords and margaret our queen do seek subversion of thy harmless life thou never didst them wrong nor no man wrong and as the butcher takes away the calf and binds the wretch and beats it when it strays bearing it to the bloody slaughterhouse even so remorseless have they borne him hence and as the dam runs lowing up and down looking the way her harmless young one went and can do nought but wail her darlings loss even so myself bewails good gloucesters case with sad unhelpful tears and with dimmd eyes look after him and cannot do him good so mighty are his vowed enemies his fortunes i will weep and twixt each groan say whos a traitor gloucester he is none exit queen free lords cold snow melts with the suns hot beams henry my lord is cold in great affairs too full of foolish pity and gloucesters show beguiles him as the mournful crocodile with sorrow snares relenting passengers or as the snake rolld in a flowring bank with shining checkerd slough doth sting a child that for the beauty thinks it excellent believe me lords were none more wise than i and yet herein i judge mine own wit good this gloucester should be quickly rid the world to rid us from the fear we have of him cardinal that he should die is worthy policy but yet we want a colour for his death tis meet he be condemnd by course of law suffolk but in my mind that were no policy the king will labour still to save his life the commons haply rise to save his life and yet we have but trivial argument more than mistrust that shows him worthy death york so that by this you would not have him die suffolk ah york no man alive so fain as i york tis york that hath more reason for his death but my lord cardinal and you my lord of suffolk say as you think and speak it from your souls weret not all one an empty eagle were set to guard the chicken from a hungry kite as place duke humphrey for the kings protector queen so the poor chicken should be sure of death suffolk madam tis true and weret not madness then to make the fox surveyor of the fold who being accusd a crafty murderer his guilt should be but idly posted over because his purpose is not executed no let him die in that he is a fox by nature provd an enemy to the flock before his chaps be staind with crimson blood as humphrey provd by reasons to my liege and do not stand on quillets how to slay him be it by gins by snares by subtlety sleeping or waking tis no matter how so he be dead for that is good deceit which mates him first that first intends deceit queen thricenoble suffolk tis resolutely spoke suffolk not resolute except so much were done for things are often spoke and seldom meant but that my heart accordeth with my tongue seeing the deed is meritorious and to preserve my sovereign from his foe say but the word and i will be his priest cardinal but i would have him dead my lord of suffolk ere you can take due orders for a priest say you consent and censure well the deed and ill provide his executioner i tender so the safety of my liege suffolk here is my hand the deed is worthy doing queen and so say i york and i and now we three have spoke it it skills not greatly who impugns our doom enter a post post great lords from ireland am i come amain to signify that rebels there are up and put the englishmen unto the sword send succours lords and stop the rage betime before the wound do grow uncurable for being green there is great hope of help cardinal a breach that craves a quick expedient stop what counsel give you in this weighty cause york that somerset be sent as regent thither tis meet that lucky ruler be employd witness the fortune he hath had in france somerset if york with all his farfet policy had been the regent there instead of me he never would have stayd in france so long york no not to lose it all as thou hast done i rather would have lost my life betimes than bring a burden of dishonour home by staying there so long till all were lost show me one scar characterd on thy skin mens flesh preservd so whole do seldom win queen nay then this spark will prove a raging fire if wind and fuel be brought to feed it with no more good york sweet somerset be still thy fortune york hadst thou been regent there might happily have provd far worse than his york what worse than nought nay then a shame take all somerset and in the number thee that wishest shame cardinal my lord of york try what your fortune is th uncivil kerns of ireland are in arms and temper clay with blood of englishmen to ireland will you lead a band of men collected choicely from each county some and try your hap against the irishmen york i will my lord so please his majesty suffolk why our authority is his consent and what we do establish he confirms then noble york take thou this task in hand york i am content provide me soldiers lords whiles i take order for mine own affairs suffolk a charge lord york that i will see performd but now return we to the false duke humphrey cardinal no more of him for i will deal with him that henceforth he shall trouble us no more and so break off the day is almost spent lord suffolk you and i must talk of that event york my lord of suffolk within fourteen days at bristol i expect my soldiers for there ill ship them all for ireland suffolk ill see it truly done my lord of york exeunt all but york york now york or never steel thy fearful thoughts and change misdoubt to resolution be that thou hopst to be or what thou art resign to death it is not worth th enjoying let palefacd fear keep with the meanborn man and find no harbour in a royal heart faster than springtime showrs comes thought on thought and not a thought but thinks on dignity my brain more busy than the labouring spider weaves tedious snares to trap mine enemies well nobles well tis politicly done to send me packing with an host of men i fear me you but warm the starved snake who cherishd in your breasts will sting your hearts twas men i lackd and you will give them me i take it kindly yet be well assurd you put sharp weapons in a madmans hands whiles i in ireland nourish a mighty band i will stir up in england some black storm shall blow ten thousand souls to heaven or hell and this fell tempest shall not cease to rage until the golden circuit on my head like to the glorious suns transparent beams do calm the fury of this madbred flaw and for a minister of my intent i have seducd a headstrong kentishman john cade of ashford to make commotion as full well he can under the tide of john mortimer in ireland have i seen this stubborn cade oppose himself against a troop of kerns and fought so long tiff that his thighs with darts were almost like a sharpquilld porpentine and in the end being rescud i have seen him caper upright like a wild morisco shaking the bloody darts as he his bells full often like a shaghaird crafty kern hath he conversed with the enemy and undiscoverd come to me again and given me notice of their villainies this devil here shall be my substitute for that john mortimer which now is dead in face in gait in speech he doth resemble by this i shall perceive the commons mind how they affect the house and claim of york say he be taken rackd and tortured i know no pain they can inflict upon him will make him say i movd him to those arms say that he thrive as tis great like he will why then from ireland come i with my strength and reap the harvest which that

serpents sting thou baleful messenger out of my sight upon thy eyeballs murderous tyranny sits in grim majesty to fright the world look not upon me for thine eyes are wounding yet do not go away come basilisk and kill the innocent gazer with thy sight for in the shade of death i shall find joy in life but double deathnow gloucesters dead queen why do you rate my lord of suffolk thus although the duke was enemy to him yet he most christianlike laments his death and for myself foe as he was to me might liquid tears or heartoffending groans or bloodconsuming sighs recall his life i would be blind with weeping sick with groans look pale as primrose with blooddrinking sighs and all to have the noble duke alive what know i how the world may deem of me for it is known we were but hollow friends it may be judgd i made the duke away so shall my name with slanders tongue be wounded and princes courts be filld with my reproach this get i by his death ay me unhappy to be a queen and crownd with infamy king henry ah woe is me for gloucester wretched man queen be woe for me more wretched than he is what dost thou turn away and hide thy face i am no loathsome leper look on me what

make my image but an alehouse sign was i for this nigh wreckd upon the sea and twice by awkward wind from englands bank drove back again unto my native clime what boded this but wellforewarning wind did seem to say seek not a scorpions nest nor set no footing on this unkind shore what did i then but cursd the gentle gusts and he that loosd them forth their brazen caves and bid them blow towards englands blessed shore or turn our stern upon a dreadful rock yet aeolus would not be a murderer but left that hateful office unto thee the prettyvaulting sea refusd to drown me knowing that thou wouldst have me drownd on shore with tears as salt as sea through thy unkindness the splitting rocks cowrd in the sinking sands and would not dash me with their ragged sides because thy flinty heart more hard than they might in thy palace perish margaret as far as i could ken thy chalky cliffs when from thy shore the tempest beat us back i stood upon the hatches in the storm and when the dusky sky began to rob my earnestgaping sight of thy lands view i took a costly jewel from my neck a heart it was bound in with diamonds and threw it towards thy land the sea receivd it and so i wishd thy body might my heart and even with this i lost fair englands view and bid mine eyes be packing with my heart and calld them blind and dusky spectacles for losing ken of albions wished coast how often have i tempted suffolks tongue the agent of thy foul inconstancy to sit and witch me as ascanius did when he to madding dido would unfold his fathers acts commencd in burning troy am i not witchd like her or thou not false like him ay me i can no more die margaret for henry weeps that thou dost live so long noise within enter warwick salisbury and many commons warwick it is reported mighty sovereign that good duke humphrey traitorously is murdred by suffolk and the cardinal beauforts means the commons like an angry hive of bees that want their leader scatter up and down and care not who

king henry o thou that judgest all things stay my thoughts my thoughts that labour to persuade my soul some violent hands were laid on humphreys life if my suspect be false forgive me god for judgment only doth belong to thee fain would i go to chafe his paly lips with twenty thousand kisses and to drain upon his face an ocean of salt tears to tell my love unto his dumb deaf trunk and with my fingers feel his hand unfeeling but all in vain are these mean obsequies and to survey his dead and earthy image what were it but to make my sorrow greater bed put forth with the body enter warwick warwick come hither gracious sovereign view this body king henry that is to see how deep my grave is made for with his soul fled all my worldly solace for seeing him i see my life in death warwick as surely as my soul intends to live with that dread king that took our state upon him to free us from his fathers wrathful curse i do believe that violent hands were laid upon the life of this thricefamed duke suffolk a dreadful oath sworn with a solemn tongue what instance gives lord warwick for his vow warwick see how the blood is settled in his face oft have i seen a timelyparted ghost of ashy semblance meagre pale and bloodless being all descended to the labouring heart who in the conflict that it holds with death attracts the same for aidance gainst the enemy which with the heart there cools and neer returneth to blush and beautify the cheek again but see his face is black and full of blood his eyeballs further out than when he livd staring full ghastly like a strangled man his hair upreard his nostrils stretchd with struggling his hands abroad displayd as one that graspd and tuggd for life and was by strength subdud look on the sheets his hair you see is sticking his wellproportiond beard made rough and rugged like to the summers corn by tempest lodged it cannot be but he was murdred here the least of all these signs were probable suffolk why warwick who should do the duke to death myself and beaufort had him in protection and we i hope sir are no murderers warwick but both of you were vowd duke humphreys foes and you forsooth had the good duke to keep tis like you would not feast him like a friend and tis well seen he found an enemy queen then you belike suspect these noblemen as guilty of duke humphreys timeless death warwick who finds the heifer dead and bleeding fresh and sees fast by a butcher with an axe but will suspect twas he that made the slaughter who finds the partridge in the puttocks nest but may imagine how the bird was dead although the kite soar with unbloodied beak even so suspicious is this tragedy queen are you the butcher suffolk wheres your knife is beaufort termd a kite where are his talons suffolk i wear no knife to slaughter sleeping men but heres a vengeful sword rusted with ease that shall be scoured in his rancorous heart that slanders me with murders crimson badge say if thou darst proud lord of warwickshire that i am faulty in duke humphreys death exeunt cardinal somerset and others warwick what dares not warwick if false suffolk dare him queen he dares not calm his contumelious spirit nor cease to be an arrogant controller though suffolk dare him twenty thousand times warwick madam be still with reverence may i say for every word you speak in his behalf is slander to your royal dignity suffolk bluntwitted lord ignoble in demeanour if ever lady wrongd her lord so much thy mother took into her blameful bed some stern untutord churl and noble stock was graft with crabtree slip whose fruit thou art and never of the nevils noble race warwick but that the guilt of murder bucklers thee and i should rob the deathsman of his fee quitting thee thereby of ten thousand shames and that my sovereigns presence makes me mild i would false murdrous coward on thy knee make thee beg pardon for thy passed speech and say it was thy mother that thou meantst that thou thyself was born in bastardy and after all this fearful homage done give thee thy hire and send thy soul to hell pernicious bloodsucker of sleeping men suffolk thou shalt be waking while i shed thy blood if from this presence thou darst go with me warwick away even now or i will drag thee hence unworthy though thou art ill cope with thee and do some service to duke humphreys ghost exeunt suffolk and warwick king henry what stronger breastplate than a heart untainted thrice is he armd that hath his quarrel just and he but naked though lockd up in steel whose conscience with injustice is corrupted a noise within queen what noise is this reenter suffolk and warwick with their weapons drawn king why how now lords your wrathful weapons drawn here in our presence dare you be so bold why what tumultuous clamour have we here suffolk the traitrous warwick with the men of bury set all upon me mighty sovereign reenter salisbury salisbury to the commons within sirs stand apart the king shall know your mind dread lord the commons send you word by me unless lord suffolk straight be done to death or banished fair englands territories they will by violence tear him from your palace and torture him with grievous lingring death they say by him the good duke humphrey died they say in him they fear your highness death and mere instinct of love and loyalty free from a stubborn opposite intent as being thought to contradict your liking makes them thus forward in his banishment they say in care of your most royal person that if your highness should intend to sleep and charge that no man should disturb your rest in pain of your dislike or pain of death yet notwithstanding such a strait edict were there a serpent seen with forked tongue that slily glided towards your majesty it were but necessary you were wakd lest being sufferd in that harmful slumber the mortal worm might make the sleep eternal and therefore do they cry though you forbid that they will guard you wheer you will or no from such fell serpents as false suffolk is with whose envenomed and fatal sting your loving uncle twenty times his worth they say is shamefully bereft of life commons within an answer from the king my lord of salisbury suffolk tis like the commons rude unpolishd hinds could send such message to their sovereign but you my lord were glad to be employd to show how quaint an orator you are but all the honour salisbury hath won is that he was the lord ambassador sent from a sort of tinkers to the king commons within an answer from the king or we will all break in king henry go salisbury and tell them all from me i thank them for their tender loving care and had i not been cited so by them yet did i purpose as they do entreat for sure my thoughts do hourly prophesy mischance unto my state by suffolks means and therefore by his majesty i swear whose far unworthy deputy i am he shall not breathe infection in this air but three days longer on the pain of death exit salisbury queen o henry let me plead for gentle suffolk king henry ungentle queen to call him gentle suffolk no more i say if thou dost plead for him thou wilt but add increase unto my wrath had i but said i would have kept my word but when i swear it is irrevocable if after three days space thou here best found on any ground that i am ruler of the world shall not be ransom for thy life come warwick come good warwick go with me i have great matters to impart to thee exeunt all but queen and suffolk queen mischance and sorrow go along with you hearts discontent and sour affliction be playfellows to keep you company theres two of you the devil make a third and threefold vengeance tend upon your steps suffolk cease gentle queen these execrations and let thy suffolk take his heavy leave queen fie coward woman and softhearted wretch has thou not spirit to curse thine enemy suffolk a plague upon them wherefore should i curse them would curses kill as doth the mandrakes groan i would invent as bitter searching terms as curst as harsh and horrible to hear deliverd strongly through my fixed teeth with full as many signs of deadly hate as leanfacd envy in her loathsome cave my tongue should stumble in mine earnest words mine eyes should sparkle like the beaten flint mine hair be fixd an end as one distract ay every joint should seem to curse and ban and even now my burdend heart would break should i not curse them poison be their drink gall worse than gall the daintiest that they taste their sweetest shade a grove of cypress trees their chiefest prospect murdring basilisks their softest touch as smart as lizards stings their music frightful as the serpents hiss and boding screechowls make the consort full all the foul terrors in darkseated hell queen enough sweet suffolk thou tormentst thyself and these dread curses like the sun gainst glass or like an overcharged gun recoil and turns the force of them upon thyself suffolk you bade me ban and will you bid me leave now by the ground that i am banishd from well could i curse away a winters night though standing naked on a mountain top where biting cold would never let grass grow and think it but a minute spent in sport queen o let me entreat thee cease give me thy hand that i may dew it with my mournful tears nor let the rain of heaven wet this place to wash away my woeful monuments o could this kiss be printed in thy hand that thou mightst think upon these by the seal through whom a thousand sighs are breathd for thee so get thee gone that i may know my grief tis but surmisd whiles thou art standing by as one that surfeits thinking on a want i will repeal thee or be well assurd adventure to be banished myself and banished i am if but from thee go speak not to me even now be gone o go not yet even thus two friends condemnd embrace and kiss and take ten thousand leaves loather a hundred times to part than die yet now farewell and farewell life with thee suffolk thus is poor suffolk ten times banished once by the king and three times thrice by thee

and where thou art not desolation i can no more live thou to joy thy life myself no joy in nought but that thou livst enter vaux queen whither goes vaux so fast what news i prithee vaux to signify unto his majesty that cardinal beaufort is at point of death for suddenly a grievous sickness took him that makes him gasp and stare and catch the air blaspheming god and cursing men on earth sometime he talks as if duke humphreys ghost were by his side sometime he calls the king and whispers to his pillow as to him the secrets of his overcharged soul and i am sent to tell his majesty that even now he cries aloud for him queen go tell this heavy message to the king exit vaux ay me what is this world what news are these but wherefore grieve i at an hours poor loss omitting suffolks exile my souls treasure why only suffolk mourn i not for thee and with the southern clouds contend in tears theirs for the earths increase mine for my sorrows now get thee hence the king thou knowst is coming if thou be found by me thou art but dead suffolk if i depart from thee i cannot live and in thy sight to die what were it else but like a pleasant slumber in thy lap here could i breathe my soul into the air as mild and gentle as the cradlebabe dying with mothers dug between its lips where from thy sight i should be raging mad and cry out for thee to close up mine eyes to have thee with thy lips to

thee whence thou camst of whom derivd were shame enough to shame thee wert thou not shameless thy father bears the type of king of naples of both the sicils and jerusalem yet not so wealthy as an english yeoman hath that poor monarch taught thee to insult it needs not nor it boots thee not proud queen unless the adage must be verified that beggars mounted run their horse to death tis beauty

the want thereof makes thee abominable thou art as opposite to every good as the antipodes are unto us or as the south to the septentrion o tigers heart wrappd in a womans hide how couldst thou drain the lifeblood of the child to bid the father wipe his eyes withal and yet be seen to bear a womans face women are soft mild pitiful and flexible thou stern obdurate flinty rough remorseless bidst thou me rage why now thou hast thy wish wouldst have me weep why now thou hast thy will for raging wind blows up incessant showers and when the rage allays the rain begins these tears are my sweet rutlands

in the thickest troop as doth a lion in a herd of neat or as a bear encompassd round with dogs who having pinchd a few and made them cry the rest stand all aloof and bark at him so fard our father with his enemies so fled his enemies my warlike father methinks tis prize enough to be his son see how the morning opes her golden gates and takes her farewell of the glorious sun how well resembles

a little axe hews down and fells the hardesttimberd oak by many hands your father was subdud but only slaughtred by the ireful arm of unrelenting clifford and the queen who crownd the gracious duke in high despite laughd in his face and when with grief he wept the ruthless queen gave him to dry his cheeks a napkin steeped in the harmless blood of sweet young rutland by rough clifford slain and after many scorns many foul taunts they took his head and on the gates of york they set the same and there it doth remain the saddest spectacle that eer i viewd edward sweet duke of york our prop to lean upon now thou art gone we have no staff no stay o clifford boistrous clifford thou hast slain the flowr of europe for his chivalry and treacherously hast thou vanquishd him for hand to hand he

lord clifford done to death warwick ten days ago i drownd these news in tears and now to add more measure to your woes i come to tell you things sith then befalln after the bloody fray at wakefield fought where your brave father breathd his latest gasp tidings as swiftly as the posts could run were brought me of your loss and his depart i then in london keeper of the king musterd my soldiers gathered flocks of friends and very well appointed as i thought marchd toward saint albans to intercept the queen bearing the king in my behalf along for by my scouts i was advertised that she was coming with a full intent to dash our late decree in parliament touching king henrys oath and your succession short tale to make we at saint albans met our battles joind and both sides fiercely fought but whether twas the coldness of the king who lookd full gently on his warlike queen that robbd my soldiers of their heated spleen or whether twas report of her success or more than common fear of cliffords rigour who thunders to his captives blood and death i cannot judge but to conclude with truth their weapons like to lightning came and went our soldiers like the nightowls lazy flight or like an idle thresher with a flail fell gently down as if they struck their friends i cheerd them up with justice of our cause with promise of high pay and great rewards but all in vain they had no heart to fight and we in them no hope to win the day so that we fled the king unto the queen lord george your brother norfolk and myself in haste posthaste are come to join with you for in the marches here we heard you were making another head to fight again edward where is the duke of norfolk gentle warwick and when came george from burgundy to england warwick some six miles off the duke is with

bear thy glories makes me speak but in this troublous time whats to be done shall we go throw away our coats of steel and wrap our bodies in black mourninggowns numbering our avemaries with our beads or shall we on the helmets of our foes tell our devotion with revengeful arms if for the last say ay and to it lords warwick why therefore warwick came to seek you out and therefore comes my brother montague attend me lords the proud insulting queen with clifford and the haught northumberland and of their feather many moe proud birds have wrought the easymelting king like wax he swore consent to your succession his oath enrolled in the parliament and now to london all the crew are gone to frustrate both his oath and what beside may make against the house of lancaster their power i think is thirty thousand strong now if the help of norfolk and myself with all the friends that thou brave earl of march amongst the loving welshmen canst procure will but amount to five and twenty thousand why via to london will we march amain and once again bestride our foaming steeds and once again cry charge upon our foes but never once again turn back and fly richard ay now methinks i hear great warwick speak neer may he live to see a sunshine day that cries retire if warwick bid him stay edward lord warwick on thy shoulder will i lean and when thou failst as god forbid the hour must edward

now hath done his shrift clarence when he was made a shriver twas for shrift king edward brothers you muse what chat we two have had gloucester the widow likes it not for she looks very sad king edward youd think it strange if i should marry her clarence to who my lord king edward why clarence to myself gloucester that would be ten days wonder at the least clarence thats a day longer than a wonder lasts gloucester by so much is the wonder in extremes king edward well jest on brothers i can tell you both her suit is granted for her husbands lands enter a nobleman nobleman my gracious lord henry your foe is taken and brought your prisoner to your palace gate king edward see that he be conveyd unto the tower and go we brothers to the man that took him to question of his apprehension widow go you along lords use her honourably exeunt all but gloucester gloucester ay edward will use women honourably would he were wasted marrow bones and all that from his loins no hopeful branch may spring to cross me from the golden time i look for and yet between my souls desire and me the lustful edwards title buried is clarence henry and his son young edward and all the unlookd for issue of their bodies to take their rooms ere i can place myself a cold premeditation for my purpose why then i do but dream on sovereignty like one that stands upon a promontory and spies a faroff shore where he would tread wishing his foot were equal with his eye and chides the sea that sunders him from thence saying hell lade it dry to have his way so do i wish the crown being so far off and so i chide the means that keeps me from it and so i say ill cut the causes off flattering me with impossibilities my eyes too quick my heart oerweens too much unless my hand and strength could equal them well say there is no kingdom then for richard what other pleasure can the world afford ill make my heaven in a ladys lap and deck my body in gay ornaments and witch sweet ladies with my words and looks o miserable thought and more unlikely than to accomplish twenty golden crowns why love forswore me in my mothers womb and for i should not deal in her soft laws she did corrupt frail nature with some bribe to shrink mine arm up like a witherd shrub to make an envious mountain on my back where sits deformity to mock my body to shape my legs of an unequal size to disproportion me in every part like to a chaos or an unlickd bearwhelp that carries no impression like the dam and am i then a man to be belovd o monstrous fault to harbour such a thought then since this earth affords no joy to me but to command to check to oerbear such as are of better person than myself ill make my heaven to dream upon the crown and whiles i live t account this world but hell until my misshapd trunk that bear this head be round impaled with a glorious crown and yet i know not how to get the crown for many lives stand between me and home and i like one lost in a thorny wood that rents the thorns and is rent with the thorns seeking a way and straying from the way not knowing how to find the open air but toiling desperately to find it out torment myself to catch the english crown and from that torment i will free myself or hew my way out with a bloody axe why i can smile and murder whiles i smile and cry content to that which grieves my heart and wet my cheeks with artificial tears and frame my face to all occasions ill drown more sailors than the mermaid shall ill slay more gazers than the basilisk ill play the orator as well as nestor deceive more slily than ulysses could and like a sinon take another troy i can add colours to the chameleon change shapes with protheus for advantages and set the murderous machiavel to school can i do this and cannot get a crown tut were it farther off ill pluck it down exit scene iii france the kings palace flourish enter lewis the french king his sister bona his admiral calld bourbon prince edward queen margaret and the earl of oxford lewis sits and riseth up again lewis fair queen of england worthy margaret sit down with us it ill befits thy state and birth that thou shouldst stand while lewis doth sit queen margaret no mighty king of france now margaret must strike her sail and learn a while to serve where kings command i was i must confess great albions queen in former golden days but now mischance hath trod my title down and with dishonour laid me on the ground where i must take like seat unto my fortune and to my humble seat conform myself lewis why say fair queen whence springs this deep despair queen margaret from such a cause as fills mine eyes with tears and stops my tongue while heart is drownd in cares lewis whateer it be be thou still like thyself and sit thee by our side seats her by him yield not thy neck to fortunes yoke but let thy dauntless mind still ride in triumph over all mischance be plain queen margaret and tell thy grief it shall be easd if france can yield relief queen margaret those gracious words revive my drooping thoughts and give my tonguetied sorrows leave to speak now therefore be it known to noble lewis that henry sole possessor of my love is of a king become a banishd man and forcd to live in scotland a forlorn while proud ambitious edward duke of york usurps the regal title and the seat of englands trueanointed lawful king this is the cause that i poor margaret with this my son prince edward henrys heir am come to crave thy just and lawful aid and if thou fail us all our hope is done scotland hath will to help but cannot help our people and our peers are both misled our treasure seizd our soldiers put to flight and as thou seest ourselves in heavy plight lewis renowned queen with patience calm the storm while we bethink a means to break it off queen margaret the more we stay the stronger grows our foe lewis the more i stay the more ill succour thee queen margaret o but impatience waiteth on true sorrow and see where comes the breeder of my sorrow enter warwick lewis whats he approacheth boldly to our presence queen margaret our earl of warwick edwards greatest friend lewis welcome brave warwick what brings thee to france he descends she ariseth queen margaret ay now begins a second storm to rise for this is he that moves both wind and tide warwick from worthy edward king of albion my lord and sovereign and thy vowed friend i come in kindness and unfeigned love first to do greetings to thy royal person and then to crave a league of amity and lastly to confirm that amity with nuptial knot if thou vouchsafe to grant that virtuous lady bona thy fair sister to englands king in lawful marriage queen margaret aside if that go forward henrys hope is done warwick to bona and gracious madam in our kings behalf i am commanded with your leave and favour humbly to kiss your hand and with my tongue to tell the passion of my sovereigns heart where fame late entring at his heedful ears hath placd thy beautys image and thy virtue queen margaret king lewis and lady bona hear me speak before you answer warwick his demand springs not from edwards wellmeant honest love but from deceit bred by necessity for how can tyrants safely govern home unless abroad they purchase great alliance to prove him tyrant this reason may suffice that henry liveth still but were he dead yet here prince edward stands king henrys son look therefore lewis that by this league and marriage thou draw not on thy danger and dishonour for though usurpers sway the rule a while yet heavns are just and time suppresseth wrongs warwick injurious margaret prince of wales and why not queen warwick because thy father henry did usurp and thou no more art prince than she is queen oxford then warwick disannuls great john of gaunt which did subdue the greatest part of spain and after john of gaunt henry the fourth whose wisdom was a mirror to the wisest and after that wise prince henry the fifth who by his prowess conquered all france from these our henry lineally descends warwick oxford how haps it in this smooth discourse you told not how henry the sixth hath lost all that which henry the fifth had gotten methinks these peers of france should smile at that but for the rest you tell a pedigree of threescore and two years a silly time to make prescription for a kingdoms worth oxford why warwick canst thou speak against thy liege whom thou obeyedst thirty and six years and not betray thy treason with a blush warwick can oxford that did ever fence the right now buckler falsehood with a pedigree for shame leave henry and call edward king oxford call him my king by whose injurious doom my elder brother the lord aubrey vere was done to death and more than so my father even in the downfall of his mellowd years when nature brought him to the door of death no warwick no while life upholds this arm this arm upholds the house of lancaster warwick and i the house of york lewis queen margaret prince edward and oxford vouchsafe at our request to stand aside while i use further conference with warwick they stand aloof queen margaret heavens grant that warwicks words bewitch him not lewis now warwick tell me even upon thy conscience is edward your true king for i were loath to link with him that were not lawful chosen warwick thereon i pawn my credit and mine honour lewis but is he gracious in the peoples eye warwick the more that henry was unfortunate lewis then further all dissembling set aside tell me for truth the measure of his love unto our sister bona warwick such it seems as may beseem a monarch like himself myself have often heard him say and swear that this his love was an eternal plant whereof the root was fixd in virtues ground the leaves and fruit maintaind with beautys sun exempt from envy but not from disdain unless the lady bona quit his pain lewis now sister let us hear your firm resolve bona your grant or your denial shall be mine to warwick yet i confess that often ere this day when i have heard your kings desert recounted mine ear hath tempted judgment to desire lewis then warwick thus our sister shall be edwards and now forthwith shall articles be drawn touching the jointure that your king must make which with her dowry shall be counterpoisd draw near queen margaret and be a witness that bona shall be wife to the english king prince of wales to edward but not to the english king queen margaret deceitful warwick it was thy device by this alliance to make void my suit before thy coming lewis was henrys friend lewis and still is friend to him and margaret but if your title to the crown be weak as may appear by edwards good success then tis but reason that i be releasd from giving aid which late i promised yet shall you have all kindness at my hand that your estate requires and mine can yield warwick henry now lives in scotland at his case where having nothing nothing can he lose and as for you yourself our quondam queen you have a father able to maintain you and better twere you troubled him than france queen margaret peace impudent and shameless warwick proud setter up and puller down of kings i will not hence till with my talk and tears both full of truth i make king lewis behold thy sly conveyance and thy lords false love for both of you are birds of selfsame feather post blowing a horn within lewis warwick this is some post to us or thee enter the post post my lord ambassador these letters are for you sent from your brother marquis montague these from our king unto your majesty and madam these for you from whom i know not they all read their letters oxford i like it well that our fair queen and mistress smiles at her news while warwick frowns at his prince of wales nay mark how lewis stamps as he were nettled i hope alls for the best lewis warwick what are thy news and yours fair queen queen margaret mine such as fill my heart with unhopd joys warwick mine full of sorrow and hearts discontent lewis what has your king married the lady grey and now to soothe your forgery and his sends me a paper to persuade me patience is this th alliance that he seeks with france dare he presume to scorn us in this manner queen margaret i told your majesty as much before this proveth edwards love and warwicks honesty warwick king lewis i here protest in sight of heaven and by the hope i have of heavenly bliss that i am clear from this misdeed of edwards no more my king for he dishonours me but most himself if he could see his shame did i forget that by the house of york my father came untimely to his death did i let pass th abuse done to my niece did i impale him with the regal crown did i put henry from his native right and am i guerdond at the last with shame shame on himself for my desert is honour and to repair my honour lost for him i here renounce him and return to henry my noble queen let former grudges pass and henceforth i am thy true servitor i will revenge his wrong to lady bona and replant henry in his former state queen margaret warwick these words have turnd my hate to love and i forgive and quite forget old faults and joy that thou becomst king henrys friend warwick so much his friend ay his unfeigned friend that if king lewis vouchsafe to furnish us with some few bands of chosen soldiers ill undertake to land them on our coast and force the tyrant from his seat by war tis not his newmade bride shall succour him and as for clarence as my letters tell me hes very likely now to fall from him for matching more for wanton lust than honour or than for strength and safety of our country bona dear brother how shall bona be revengd but by thy help to this distressed queen queen margaret renowned prince how shall poor henry live unless thou rescue him from foul despair bona my quarrel and this english queens are one warwick and mine fair lady bona joins with yours lewis and mine with hers and thine and margarets therefore at last i firmly am resolvd you shall have aid queen margaret let me give humble thanks for all at once lewis then englands messenger return in post and tell false edward thy supposed king that lewis of france is sending over masquers to revel it with him and his new bride thou seest whats past go fear thy king withal bona tell him in hope hell prove a widower shortly ill wear the willowgarland for his sake queen margaret tell him my mourning weeds are laid aside and i am ready to put armour on warwick tell him from me that he hath done me wrong and therefore ill uncrown him eret be long theres thy reward be gone exit post lewis but warwick thou and oxford with five thousand men shall cross the seas and bid false edward battle and as occasion serves this noble queen and prince shall follow with a fresh supply yet ere thou go but answer me one doubt what pledge have we of thy firm loyalty warwick this shall assure my constant loyalty that if our queen and this young prince agree ill join mine eldest daughter and my joy to him forthwith in holy wedlock bands queen margaret yes i agree and thank you for your motion son edward she is fair and virtuous therefore delay not give thy hand to warwick and with thy hand thy faith irrevocable that only warwicks daughter shall be thine prince of wales yes i accept her for she well deserves it and here to pledge my vow i give my hand he gives his hand to warwick lewis stay we now these soldiers shall be levied and thou lord bourbon our high admiral shall waft them over with our royal fleet i long till edward fall by wars mischance for mocking marriage with a dame of france exeunt all but warwick warwick i came from edward as ambassador but i return his sworn and mortal foe matter of marriage was the charge he gave me but dreadful war shall answer his demand had he none else to make a stale but me then none but i shall turn his jest to sorrow i was the chief that raisd him to the crown and ill be chief to bring him down again not that i pity henrys misery but seek revenge on edwards mockery exit act iv scene i london the palace enter gloucester clarence somerset and montague gloucester now tell me brother clarence what think you of this new marriage with the lady grey hath not our brother made a worthy choice clarence alas you know tis far from hence to france how could he stay till warwick made return somerset my lords forbear this talk here comes the king flourish enter king edward attended lady grey as queen pembroke stafford hastings and others four stand on one side and four on the other gloucester and his wellchosen bride clarence i mind to tell him plainly what i think king edward now brother of clarence how like you our choice that you stand pensive as half malcontent clarence as well as lewis of france or the earl of warwick which are so weak of courage and in judgment that theyll take no offence at our abuse king edward suppose they take offence without a cause they are but lewis and warwick i am edward your king and warwicks and must have my will gloucester and shall have your will because our king yet hasty marriage seldom proveth well king edward yea brother richard are you offended too gloucester not i no god forbid that i should wish them severd whom god hath joind together ay and twere pity to sunder them that yoke so well together king edward setting your scorns and your mislike aside tell me some reason why the lady grey should not become my wife and englands queen and you too somerset and montague speak freely what you think clarence then this is mine opinion that king lewis becomes your enemy for mocking him about the marriage of the lady bona gloucester and warwick doing what you gave in charge is now dishonoured by this new marriage king edward what if both lewis and warwick be appeasd by such invention as i can devise montague yet to have joind with france in such alliance would more have strengthned this our commonwealth gainst foreign storms than any homebred marriage hastings why knows not montague that of itself england is safe if true within itself montague but the safer when tis backd with france hastings tis better using france than trusting france let us be backd with god and with the seas which he hath givn for fence impregnable and with their helps only defend ourselves in them and in ourselves our safety lies clarence for this one speech lord hastings well deserves to have the heir of the lord hungerford king edward ay what of that it was my will and grant and for this once my will shall stand for law gloucester and yet methinks your grace hath not done well to give the heir and daughter of lord scales unto the brother of your loving bride she better would have fitted me or clarence but in your bride you bury brotherhood clarence or else you would not have bestowd the heir of the lord bonville on your new wifes son and leave your brothers to go speed elsewhere king edward alas poor clarence is it for a wife that thou art malcontent i will provide thee clarence in choosing for yourself you showd your judgment which being shallow you shall give me leave to play the broker in mine own behalf and to that end i shortly mind to leave you king edward leave me or tarry edward will be king and not be tied unto his brothers will queen elizabeth my lords before it pleasd his majesty to raise my state to title of a queen do me but right and you must all confess that i was not ignoble of descent and meaner than myself have had like fortune but as this title honours me and mine so your dislikes to whom i would be pleasing doth cloud my joys with danger and with sorrow king edward my love forbear to fawn upon their frowns what danger or what sorrow can befall thee so long as edward is thy constant friend and their true sovereign whom they must obey nay whom they shall obey and love thee too unless they seek for hatred at my hands which if they do yet will i keep thee safe and they shall feel the vengeance of my wrath gloucester aside i hear yet say not much but think the more enter a post king edward now messenger what letters or what news from france messenger my sovereign liege no letters and few words but such as i without your special pardon dare not relate king edward go to we pardon thee therefore in brief tell me their words as near as thou canst guess them what answer makes king lewis unto our letters messenger at my depart these were his very words go tell false edward the supposed king that lewis of france is sending over masquers to revel it with him and his new bride king edward is lewis so brave belike he thinks me henry but what said lady bona to my marriage messenger these were her words uttred with mild disdain tell him in hope hell prove a widower shortly ill wear the willowgarland for his sake king edward i blame not her she could say little less she had the wrong but what said henrys queen for i have heard that she was there in place messenger tell him quoth she my mourning weeds are done and i am ready to put armour on king edward belike she minds to play the amazon but what said warwick to these injuries messenger he more incensd against your majesty than all the rest dischargd me with these words tell him from me that he hath done me wrong and therefore ill uncrown him eret be long king edward ha durst the traitor breathe out so proud words well i will arm me being thus forewarnd they shall have wars and pay for their presumption but say is warwick friends with margaret messenger ay gracious sovereign they are so linkd in friendship that young prince edward marries warwicks daughter clarence belike the elder clarence will have the younger now brother king farewell and sit you fast for i will hence to warwicks other daughter that though i want a kingdom yet in marriage i may not prove inferior to yourself you that love me and warwick follow me exit and somerset follows gloucester aside not i my thoughts aim at a further matter i stay not for the love of edward but the crown king edward clarence and somerset both gone to warwick yet am i armd against the worst can happen and haste is needful in this desprate case pembroke and stafford you in our behalf go levy men and make prepare for war they are already or quickly will be landed myself in person will straight follow you exeunt pembroke and stafford but ere i go hastings and montague resolve my doubt you twain of all the rest are near to warwick by blood and by alliance tell me if you love warwick more than me if it be so then both depart to him i rather wish you foes than hollow friends but if you mind to hold your true obedience give me assurance with some friendly vow that i may never have you in suspect montague so god help montague as he proves true hastings and hastings as he favours edwards cause king edward now brother richard will you stand by us gloucester ay in despite of all that shall withstand you king edward why so then am i sure of victory now therefore let us hence and lose no hour till we meet warwick with his foreign powr exeunt scene ii a plain in warwickshire enter warwick and oxford with french soldiers warwick trust me my lord all hitherto goes well the common people by numbers swarm to us enter clarence and somerset but see where somerset and clarence comes speak suddenly my lords are we all friends clarence fear not that my lord warwick then gentle clarence welcome unto warwick and welcome somerset i hold it cowardice to rest mistrustful where a noble heart hath pawnd an open hand in sign of love else might i think that clarence edwards brother were but a feigned friend to our proceedings but welcome sweet clarence my daughter shall be thine and now what rests but in nights coverture thy brother being carelessly encampd his soldiers lurking in the towns about and but attended by a simple guard we may surprise and take him at our pleasure our scouts have found the adventure very easy that as ulysses and stout diomede with sleight and manhood stole to rhesus tents and brought from thence the thracian fatal steeds so we well coverd with the nights black mantle at unawares may beat down edwards guard and seize himself i say not slaughter him for i intend but only to surprise him you that will follow me to this attempt applaud the name of henry with your leader they all cry henry why then lets on our way in silent sort for warwick and his friends god and saint george exeunt scene iii edwards camp near warwick enter three watchmen to guard the kings tent first watchman come on my masters each man take his stand the king by this is set him down to sleep second watchman what will he not to bed first watchman why no for he hath made a solemn vow never to lie and take his natural rest till warwick or himself be quite suppressd second watchman tomorrow then belike shall be the day if warwick be so near as men report third watchman but say i pray what nobleman is that that with the king here resteth in his tent first watchman tis the lord hastings the kings chiefest friend third watchman o is it so but why commands the king that his chief followers lodge in towns about him while he himself keeps in the cold field second watchman tis the more honour because more dangerous third watchman ay but give me worship and quietness i like it better than dangerous honour if warwick knew in what estate he stands tis to be doubted he would waken him

since a fresh admirer of what i saw there buckingham an untimely ague stayd me a prisoner in my chamber when those suns of glory those two lights of men met in the vale of andren norfolk twixt guynes and arde i was then present saw them salute on horseback beheld them when they lighted how they clung in their embracement as they grew together which had they what four thrond ones could have weighd such a compounded one buckingham all the whole time i was my chambers prisoner norfolk then you lost the view of earthly glory men might say till this time pomp was single but now married to one above itself each following day became the next days master till the last made former wonders its today the french all clinquant all in gold like heathen gods shone down the english and tomorrow they made britain india every man that stood showd like a mine their dwarfish pages were as cherubins an gilt the madams too not usd to toil did almost sweat to bear the pride upon them that their very labour was to them as a painting now this masque was cried incomparable and th ensuing night made it a fool and beggar the two kings equal in lustre were now best now worst as presence did present them him in eye still him in praise and being present both twas said they saw but one and no discerner durst wag his tongue in censure when these suns for so they phrase emby their heralds challengd the noble spirits to arms they did perform beyond thoughts compass that former fabulous story being now seen possible enough got credit that bevis was believd buckingham o you go far norfolk as i belong to worship and affect in honour honesty the tract of evrything would by a good discourser lose some life which actions self was tongue to all was royal to the disposing of it nought rebelld order gave each thing view the office did distinctly his full function buckingham who did guide i mean who set the body and the limbs of this great sport together as you guess norfolk one certes that promises no element in such a business buckingham i pray you who my lord norfolk all this was ordred by the good discretion of the right reverend cardinal of york buckingham the devil speed him no mans pie is freed from his ambitious finger what had he to do in these fierce vanities i wonder that such a keech can with his very bulk take up the rays o th beneficial sun and keep it from the earth norfolk surely sir theres in him stuff that puts him to these ends for being not proppd by ancestry whose grace chalks successors their way nor calld upon for high feats done to th crown neither allied to eminent assistants but spiderlike out of his selfdrawing web a gives us note the force of his own merit makes his way a gift that heaven gives for him which buys a place next to the king abergavenny i cannot tell what heaven hath given himlet some graver eye pierce into that but i can see his pride peep through each part of him whence has he that if not from hell the devil is a niggard or has given all before and he begins a new hell in himself buckingham why the devil upon this french going out took he upon him without the privity o th kingt appoint who should attend on him he makes up the file of all the gentry for the most part such to whom as great a charge as little honour he meant to lay upon and his own letter the honourable board of council out must fetch him in he papers abergavenny i do know kinsmen of mine three at the least that have by this so sickend their estates that never they shall abound as formerly buckingham o many have broke their backs with laying manors on em for this great journey what did this vanity but minister communication of a most poor issue norfolk grievingly i think the peace between the french and us not values the cost that did conclude it buckingham every man after the hideous storm that followd was a thing inspird and not consulting broke into a general prophecythat this tempest dashing the garment of this peace aboded the sudden breach ont norfolk which is budded out for france hath flawd the league and hath attachd our merchants goods at bordeaux abergavenny is it therefore th ambassador is silencd norfolk marry ist abergavenny a proper tide of a peace and purchasd at a superfluous rate buckingham why all this business our reverend cardinal carried norfolk like it your grace the state takes notice of the private difference betwixt you and the cardinal i advise you and take it from a heart that wishes towards you honour and plenteous safetythat you read the cardinals malice and his potency together to consider further that what his high hatred would effect wants not a minister in his power you know his nature that hes revengeful and i know his sword hath a sharp edgeits long andt may be said it reaches far and where twill not extend thither he darts it bosom up my counsel youll find it wholesome lo where comes that rock that i advise your shunning enter cardinal wolsey the purse borne before him certain

trick hes gone to th king ill follow and outstare him norfolk stay my lord and let your reason with your choler question what tis you go about to climb steep hills requires slow pace at first anger is like a full hot horse who being allowd his way selfmettle tires him not a man in england can advise me like you be to yourself as you would to your friend buckingham ill to the king and from a mouth of honour quite cry down this ipswich fellows insolence or proclaim theres difference in no persons norfolk be advisd heat not a furnace for your foe so hot that it do singe yourself we may outrun by violent swiftness that which we run at and lose by overrunning know you not the fire that mounts the liquor tillt run oer in seeming to augment it wastes it be advisd i say again there is no english soul more stronger to direct you than yourself if with the sap of reason you would quench or but allay the fire of passion buckingham sir i am thankful to you and ill go along by your prescription but this topproud fellow whom from the flow of gan i name not but from sincere motions by intelligence and proofs as clear as founts in july when we see each grain of graveli do know to be corrupt and treasonous norfolk say not treasonous buckingham to th king ill sayt and make my vouch as strong as shore of rock attend this holy fox or wolf or bothfor he is equal ravnous as he is subtle and as prone to mischief as able to performt his mind and place infecting one another yea reciprocally only to show his pomp as well in france as here at home suggests the king our master to this last costly treaty th interview that swallowed so much treasure and like a glass did break i th wrenching norfolk faith and so it did buckingham pray give me favour sir this cunning cardinal the articles o th combination drew as himself pleasd and they were ratified as he cried thus let be to as much end as give a crutch to th dead but our countcardinal has done this and tis well for worthy wolsey who cannot err he did it now this follows which as i take it is a kind of puppy to th old dam treason charles the emperor under pretence to see the queen his aunt for twas indeed his colour but he came to whisper wolseyhere makes visitation his fears were that the interview betwixt england and france might through their amity breed him some prejudice for from this league peepd harms that menacd himprivily deals with our cardinal and as i trow which i do well for i am sure the emperor paid ere he promisd whereby his suit was granted ere it was askdbut when the way was made and pavd with gold the emperor thus desird that he would please to alter the kings course and break the foresaid peace let the king know as soon he shall by me that thus the cardinal does buy and sell his honour as he pleases and for his own advantage norfolk i am sorry to hear this of him and could wish he were something mistaken int buckingham no not a syllable i do pronounce him in that very shape he shall

thank your majesty that you would love yourself and in that love not unconsidered leave your honour nor the dignity of your office is the point of my petition king lady mine proceed queen katharine i am solicited not by a few and those of true condition that your subjects are in great grievance there have been commissions sent down among em which hath flawd the heart of all their loyalties wherein although my good lord cardinal they vent reproaches most bitterly on you as putteron of these exactions yet the king our master whose honour heaven shield from soileven he escapes not language unmannerly yea such which breaks the sides of loyalty and almost appears in loud rebellion norfolk not almost appears it doth appear for upon these taxations the clothiers all not able to maintain the many to them longing have put of the spinsters carders fullers weavers who unfit for other life compelld by hunger and lack of other means in desperate manner daring th event to th teeth are all in uproar and danger serves among them king taxation wherein and what taxation my lord cardinal you that are blamd for it alike with us know you of this taxation wolsey please you sir i know but of a single part in aught pertains to th state and front but in that file where others tell steps with me queen katharine no my lord you know no more than others but you frame things that are known alike which are not wholesome to those which would not know them and yet must perforce be their acquaintance these exactions whereof my sovereign would have note they are most pestilent to th hearing and to bear em the back is sacrifice to th load they say they are devisd by you or else you suffer too hard an exclamation king still exaction the nature of it in what kind lets know is this exaction queen katharine i am much too venturous in tempting of your patience but am boldned under your promisd pardon the subjects grief comes through commissions which compels from each the sixth part of his substance to be levied without delay and the pretence for this is namd your wars in france this makes bold mouths tongues spit their duties out and cold hearts freeze allegiance in them their curses now live where their prayers did and its come to pass this tractable obedience is a slave to each incensed will i would your highness would give it quick consideration for there is no primer business king by my life this is against our pleasure wolsey and for me i have no further gone in this than by a single voice and that not passd me but by learned approbation of the judges if i am traducd by ignorant tongues which neither know my faculties nor person yet will be the chronicles of my doing let me say tis but the fate of place and the rough brake that virtue must go through we must not stint our necessary actions in the fear to cope malicious censurers which ever as ravnous fishes do a vessel follow that is newtrimmd but benefit no further than vainly longing what we oft do best by sick interpreters once weak ones is not ours or not allowd what worst as oft hitting a grosser quality is cried up for our best act if we shall stand still in fear our motion will be mockd or carpd at we should take root here where we sit or sit statestatues only king things done well and with a care exempt themselves from fear things done without example in their issue are to be feard have you a precedent of this commission i believe not any we must not rend our subjects from our laws and stick them in our will sixth part of each a trembling contribution why we take from every tree lop bark and part o th timber and though we leave it with a root thus hackd the air will drink the sap to every county where this is questiond send our letters with free pardon to each man that has denied the force of this commission pray look tot i put it to your care wolsey aside to the secretary a word with you let there be letters writ to every shire of the kings grace and pardon the grieved commons

high person his will is most malignant and it stretches beyond you to your friends queen katharine my learnd lord cardinal deliver all with charity king speak on how grounded he his title to the crown

his confessor who fed him every minute with words of sovereignty king how knowst thou this surveyor not long before your highness sped to france the duke being at the rose within the parish saint lawrence poultney did of me demand what was the speech among the londoners concerning the french journey i replied men feard the french would prove perfidious to the kings danger presently the duke said twas the fear indeed and that he doubted twould prove the verity of certain words spoke by a holy monk that oft says he hath sent to me wishing me to permit john de la car my chaplain a choice hour to hear from him a matter of some moment whom after under the confessions seal he solemnly had sworn that what he spoke my chaplain to no creature living but to me should utter with demure

you may see lepidus and henceforth know it is not caesars natural vice to hate our great competitor from alexandria this is the news he fishes drinks and wastes the lamps of night in revel is not more manlike than cleopatra nor the queen of ptolemy more womanly than he hardly gave audience or vouchsafd to think he had partners you shall find there a man who is the abstract of all faults that all men follow lepidus i must not think there are evils enow to darken all his goodness his faults in him seem as the spots of heaven more fiery by nights blackness hereditary rather than purchasd what he cannot change than what he chooses caesar you are too indulgent lets grant it is not amiss to tumble on the bed of ptolemy to give a kingdom for a mirth to sit and keep the turn of tippling with a slave to reel the streets at noon and stand the buffet with knaves that smell of sweat say this becomes him as his composure must be rare indeed whom these things cannot blemish yet must antony no way excuse his foils when we do bear so great weight in his lightness if he filld his vacancy with his voluptuousness full surfeits and the dryness of his bones call on him fort but to confound such time that drums him from his sport and speaks as loud as his own state and ours tis to be chid as we rate boys who being mature in knowledge pawn their experience to their present pleasure and so rebel to

though daintily brought up with patience more than savages could suffer thou didst drink the stale of horses and the gilded puddle which beasts would cough at thy palate then did deign the roughest berry on the rudest hedge yea like the stag when snow the pasture sheets the barks of trees thou browsd on the alps it is reported thou didst eat strange flesh which some did die to look on and all this it wounds thine honour that i speak it now was borne so like a soldier that thy cheek so much as lankd not lepidus tis pity of him caesar let his shames quickly drive him to rome tis time we twain did show ourselves i th field and to that end assemble we immediate council pompey thrives in our idleness lepidus tomorrow caesar i shall be furnishd to inform you rightly both what by sea and

of war antony you do mistake your business my brother never did urge me in his act i did inquire it and have my learning from some true reports that drew their swords with you did he not rather discredit my authority with yours and make the wars alike against my stomach having alike your cause of this my letters before did satisfy you if youll patch a quarrel as matter whole you have not to make it with it must not be with this caesar you praise yourself by laying defects of judgment to me but you patchd up your excuses antony not so not so i know you could not lack i am certain ont very necessity of this thought that i your partner in the cause gainst which he fought could not with graceful eyes attend those wars which fronted mine own peace as for my wife i would you had her spirit in such another the third o th world is yours which with a snaffle you may pace easy but not such a wife enobarbus would we had all such wives that the men might go to wars with the women antony so

indeed against us passd but that the scambling and unquiet time did push it out of farther question ely but how my lord shall we resist it now canterbury it must be thought on if it pass against us we lose the better half of our possession for all the temporal lands which men devout by testament have given to the church would they strip from us being valud thus as much as would maintain to the kings honour full fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights six thousand and two hundred good esquires and to relief of lazars and weak age of indigent faint souls past corporal toil a hundred almshouses right well supplied and to the coffers of the king beside a thousand pounds by th year thus runs the bill ely this would drink deep canterbury t would drink the cup and all ely but what prevention canterbury the king is full of grace and fair regard ely and a true lover of the holy church canterbury the courses of his youth promisd it not the breath no sooner left his fathers body but that his wildness mortified in him seemd to die too yea at that very moment consideration like an angel came and whippd th offending adam out of him leaving his body as a paradise tenvelop and contain celestial spirits never was such a sudden scholar made never came reformation in a flood with such a heady currance scouring faults nor never hydraheaded wilfulnes so soon did lose his seat and all at once as in this king ely we are blessed in the change canterbury hear him but reason in divinity and alladmiring with an inward wish you would desire the king were made a prelate hear him debate of commonwealth affairs you would say it hath been all in all his study list his discourse of war and you shall hear a fearful battle rendred you in music turn him to any cause of policy the gordian knot of it he will unloose familiar as his garter that when he speaks the air a charterd libertine is still and the mute wonder lurketh in mens ears to steal his sweet and honeyd sentences so that the art and practic part of life must be the mistress to this theoric which is a wonder how his grace should glean it since his addiction was to courses vain his companies unletterd rude and shallow his hours filld up with riots banquets sports and never noted in him any study any retirement any sequestration from open haunts and popularity ely the strawberry grows underneath the nettle and wholesome berries thrive and ripen best neighbourd by fruit of baser quality and so the prince obscurd his contemplation under the veil of wildness which no doubt grew like the summer grass fastest by night unseen yet crescive in his faculty canterbury it must be so for miracles are ceasd and therefore we must needs admit the means how things are perfected ely but my good lord how now for mitigation of this bill urgd by the commons doth his majesty incline to it or no canterbury he seems indifferent or rather swaying more upon our part than cherishing th exhibiters against us for i have made an offer to his majesty upon our spiritual convocation and in regard of causes now in hand which i have opend to his grace at large as touching france to give a greater sum than ever at one time the clergy yet did to his predecessors part withal ely how did this offer seem receivd my lord canterbury with good acceptance of his majesty save that there was not time enough to hear as i perceivd his grace would fain have done the severals and unhidden passages of his true tides to some certain dukedoms and generally to the crown and seat of france derivd from edward his greatgrandfather ely what was th impediment that broke this off canterbury the french ambassador upon that instant cravd audience and the hour i think is come to give him hearing is it four oclock ely

thoughts concerning us and france enter the archbishop of canterbury and the bishop of ely canterbury god and his angels guard your sacred throne and make you long become it king henry sure we thank you my learned lord we pray you to proceed and justly and religiously unfold why the law salique that they have in france or should or should not bar us in our claim and god forbid my dear and faithful lord that you should fashion wrest or bow your reading or nicely charge your understanding soul with opening titles miscreate whose right suits not in native colours with the truth for god doth know how many now in health shall drop their blood in approbation of what your reverence shall incite us to therefore take heed how you impawn our person how you awake our sleeping sword of war we charge you in the name of god take heed for never two such kingdoms did contend without much fall of blood whose guiltless drops are every one a woe a sore complaint gainst him whose wrongs gives edge unto the swords that makes such waste in brief mortality under this conjuration speak my lord for we will hear note and believe in heart that what you speak is in your conscience washd as pure as sin with baptism canterbury then hear me gracious sovereign and you peers that owe yourselves your lives and services to this imperial throne there is no bar to make against your highness claim to france but this which they produce from pharamond in terram salicam mulieres ne succedant no woman shall succeed in salique land which salique land the french unjustly gloze to be the realm of france and pharamond the founder of this law and female bar yet their own authors faithfully affirm that the land salique is in germany between the floods of sala and of elbe where charles the great having subdud the saxons there left behind and settled certain french who holding in disdain the german women for some dishonest manners of their life establishd then this law to wit no female should be inheritrix in salique land which salique as i said twixt elbe and sala is at this day in germany calld meisen then doth it well appear the salique law was not devised for the realm of france nor did the french possess the salique land until four hundred one and twenty years after defunction of king pharamond idly supposd the founder of this law who died within the year of our redemption four hundred twentysix and charles the great subdud the saxons and did seat the french beyond the river sala in the year eight hundred five besides their writers say king pepin which deposed childeric did as heir general being descended of blithild which was daughter to king clothair make claim and title to the crown of france hugh capet also who usurpd the crown of charles the duke of lorraine sole heir male of the true line and stock of charles the great to find his title with some shows of truth though in pure truth it was corrupt and naught conveyd himself as th heir to th lady lingare daughter to charlemain who was the son to lewis the emperor and lewis the son of charles the great also king lewis the tenth who was sole heir to the usurper capet could not keep quiet in his conscience wearing the crown of france till satisfied that fair queen isabel his grandmother was lineal of the lady ermengare daughter to charles the foresaid duke of lorraine by the which marriage the line of charles the great was reunited to the crown of france so that as clear as is the summers sun king pepins title and hugh capets claim king lewis his satisfaction all appear to hold in right and tide of the female so do the kings of france unto this day howbeit they would hold up this salique law to bar your highness claiming from the female and rather choose to hide them in a net than amply to imbar their crooked tides usurpd from you and your progenitors king henry may i with right and conscience make this claim canterbury the sin upon my head dread sovereign for in the book of numbers is it writ when the man dies let the inheritance descend unto the daughter gracious lord stand for your own unwind your bloody flag look back into your mighty ancestors go my dread lord to your greatgrandsires tomb from whom you claim invoke his warlike spirit and your greatuncles edward the black prince who on the french ground playd a tragedy making defeat on the fun power of france whiles his most mighty father on a hill stood smiling to behold his lions whelp forage in blood of french nobility o noble english that could entertain with half their forces the full pride of france and let another half stand laughing by all out of work and cold for action ely awake remembrance of these valiant dead and with your puissant arm renew their feats you are their heir you sit upon their throne the blood and courage that renowned them runs in your veins and my thricepuissant liege is in the very maymorn of his youth ripe for exploits and mighty enterprises exeter your brother kings and monarchs of the earth do all expect that you should rouse yourself as did the former lions of your blood westmoreland they know your grace hath cause and means and might so hath your highness never king of england had nobles richer and more loyal subjects whose hearts have left their bodies here in england and lie paviliond in the fields of france canterbury o let their bodies follow my dear liege with blood and sword and fire to win your right in aid whereof we of the spiritualty will raise your highness such a mighty sum as never did the clergy at one time bring in to any of your ancestors king henry we must not only arm t invade the french but lay down our proportions to defend against the scot who will make road upon us with all advantages canterbury they of those marches gracious sovereign shall be a wall sufficient to defend our inland from the pilfering borderers king henry we do not mean the coursing snatchers only but fear the main intendment of the scot who hath been still a giddy neighbour to us for you shall read that my greatgrandfather never went with his forces into france but that the scot on his unfurnishd kingdom came pouring like the tide into a breach with ample and brim fulness of his force galling the gleaned land with hot assays girdling with grievous siege castles and towns that england being empty of defence hath shook and trembled at th ill neighbourhood canterbury she hath been then more feard than harmd my liege for hear her but exampled by herself when all her chivalry hath been in france and she a mourning widow of her nobles she hath herself not only well defended but taken and impounded as a stray the king of scots whom she did send to france to fill king edwards fame with prisoner kings and make her chronicle as rich with praise as is the ooze and bottom of the sea with sunken wreck and sumless treasuries westmoreland but theres a saying very old and true if that you will france win then with scotland first begin for once the eagle england being in prey to her unguarded nest the weasel scot comes sneaking and so sucks her princely eggs playing the mouse in absence of the cat to tear and havoc more than she can eat exeter it follows then the cat must stay at home yet that is but a crushd necessity since we have locks to safeguard necessaries and pretty traps to catch the petty thieves while that the armed hand doth fight abroad th advised head defends itself at home for government though high and low and lower put into parts doth keep in one consent congreeing in a full and natural close like music canterbury therefore doth heaven divide the state of man in divers functions setting endeavour in continual motion to which is fixed as an aim or but obedience for so work the honey bees creatures that by a rule in nature teach the act of order to a peopled kingdom they have a king and officers of sorts where some like magistrates correct at home others like merchants venture trade abroad others like soldiers armed in their stings make boot upon the summers velvet buds which pillage they with merry march bring home to the tentroyal of their emperor who busied in his majesty surveys the singing masons building roofs of gold the civil citizens kneading up the honey the poor mechanic porters crowding in their heavy burdens at his narrow gate the sadeyd justice with his surly hum delivering oer to executors pale the lazy yawning drone i this infer that many things having full reference to one consent may work contrariously as many arrows loosed several ways come to one mark as many ways meet in one town as many fresh streams meet in one salt sea as many lines close in the dials centre so many a thousand actions once afoot end in one purpose and be all well home without defeat therefore to france my liege divide your happy england into four whereof take you one quarter into france and you withal shall make all gallia shake if we with thrice such powers left at home cannot defend our own doors from the dog let us be worried and our nation lose the name of hardiness and policy king henry call in the messengers sent from the dauphin exeunt some attendants now are we well resolvd and by gods help and yours the noble sinews of our power france being ours well bend it to our awe or break it all to pieces or there well sit ruling in large and ample empery oer france and all her almost kingly dukedoms or lay these bones in an unworthy urn tombless with no remembrance over them either our history shall with full mouth speak freely of our acts or else our grave like turkish mute shall have a tongueless mouth not worshippd with a waxen epitaph enter ambassadors of france now are we well prepard to know the pleasure of our fair cousin dauphin for we hear your greeting is from him not from the king ambassador mayt please your majesty to give us leave freely to render what we have in charge or shall we sparingly show you far of the dauphins meaning and our embassy king henry we are no tyrant but a christian king unto whose grace our passion is as subject as are our wretches fettred in our prisons therefore with frank and with uncurbed plainness tell us the dauphins mind ambassador thus then in few your highness lately sending into france did claim some certain dukedoms in the right of your great predecessor king edward the third in answer of which claim the prince our master says that you savour too much of your youth and bids you be advisd theres nought in france that can be with a nimble galliard won you cannot revel into dukedoms there he therefore sends you meeter for your spirit this tun of treasure and in lieu of this desires you let the dukedoms that you claim hear no more of you this the dauphin speaks king henry what treasure uncle exeter tennisballs my liege king henry we are glad the dauphin is so pleasant with us his present and your pains we thank you for when we have matchd our rackets to these balls we will in france by gods grace play a set shall strike his fathers crown into the hazard tell him he hath made a match with such a wrangler that all the courts of france will be disturbd with chaces and we understand him well how he comes oer us with our wilder days not measuring what use we made of them we never valud this poor seat of england and therefore living hence did give ourself to barbarous licence as tis ever common that men are merriest when they are from home but tell the dauphin i will keep my state be like a king and show my sail of greatness when i do rouse me in my throne of france for that i have laid by my majesty and plodded like a man for workingdays but i will rise there with so full a glory that i will dazzle all the eyes of france yea strike the dauphin blind to look on us and tell the pleasant prince this mock of his hath turnd his balls to gunstones and his soul shall stand sore charged for the wasteful vengeance that shall fly with them for many a thousand widows shall this his mock mock of their dear husbands mock mothers from their sons mock castles down and some are yet ungotten and unborn that shall have cause to curse the dauphins scorn but this lies all within the will of god to whom i do appeal and in whose name tell you the dauphin i am coming on to venge me as i may and to put forth my rightful hand in a wellhallowd cause so get you hence in peace and tell the dauphin his jest will savour but of shallow wit when thousands weep more than did laugh at it convey them with safe conduct fare you well exeunt ambassadors exeter this was a merry message king henry we hope to make the sender blush at it therefore my lords omit no happy hour that may give furthrance to our expedition for we have now no thought in us but france save those to god that run before our business therefore let our proportions for these wars be soon collected and all things thought upon that may with reasonable swiftness ad more feathers to our wings for god before well chide this dauphin at his fathers door therefore let every man now task his thought that this fair action may on foot be brought exeunt act ii prologue flourish enter chorus chorus now all the youth of england are on fire and silken dalliance in the wardrobe lies now thrive the armourers and honours thought reigns solely in the breast of every man they sell the pasture now to buy the horse following the mirror of all christian kings with winged heels as english mercuries for now sits expectation in the air and hides a sword from hilts unto the point with crowns imperial crowns and

england model to thy inward greatness like little body with a mighty heart what mightst thou do that honour would thee do were all thy children kind and natural but see thy fault france hath in thee found out a nest of hollow bosoms which he fills with treacherous crowns and three corrupted men one richard earl of cambridge and the second henry lord scroop of masham and the third sir thomas grey knight of northumberland have for the gilt of france o guilt indeed confirmd conspiracy with fearful france and by their hands this grace of kings must die if hell and treason hold their promises ere

thou have practisd on me for thy use may it be possible that foreign hire could out of thee extract one spark of evil that might annoy my finger tis so strange that though the truth of it stands off as gross as black and white my eye will scarcely see it treason and murder ever kept together as two yokedevils sworn to eithers purpose working so grossly in a natural cause that admiration did not whoop at them but thou gainst all proportion didst bring in wonder to wait on treason and on murder and whatsoever cunning fiend it was that wrought upon thee so preposterously hath got the voice in hell for excellence and other devils that suggest by treasons do botch and bungle up damnation with patches colours and with forms being fetchd from glistring semblances of piety but he that temperd thee bade thee stand up gave thee no instance why thou shouldst do treason unless to dub thee with the name of traitor if that same demon that hath gulld thee thus should with his lion gait walk the whole world he might return to vasty tartar back and tell the legions i can never win a soul so easy as that englishmans o how hast thou with jealousy infected the sweetness of affiance show men

of cambridge i arrest thee of high treason by the name of henry lord scroop of masham i arrest thee of high treason by the name of thomas grey knight of northumberland scroop our purposes god justly hath discoverd and i repent my fault more than my death which i beseech your highness to forgive although my body pay the price of it cambridge for me the gold of france did not seduce although i did admit it as a motive the sooner to effect what i intended but god be thanked for prevention which i in sufferance heartily will rejoice beseeching god and you to pardon me grey never did faithful subject more rejoice at the discovery of most dangerous treason than i do at this hour joy oer myself prevented from a damned enterprise my fault but not my body pardon sovereign king henry god quit

through the foul womb of night the hum of either army stilly sounds that the fixd sentinels almost receive the secret whispers of each others watch fire answers fire and through their paly flames each battle sees the others umberd face steed threatens steed in high and boastful neighs piercing the nights dull ear and from the tents the armourers accomplishing the knights with busy hammers closing rivets up give dreadful note of preparation the country cocks do crow the clocks do ton and the third hour of drowsy morning name proud of their numbers and secure in soul the confident and overlusty french do the lowrated english play at dice and chide the cripple tardygaited night who like a foul and ugly witch doth limp so tediously away the poor condemned english like sacrifices by their watchful fires sit patiently and inly ruminate the mornings danger and their gesture sad investing lanklean cheeks and warworn coats presenteth them unto the gazing moon so many horrid ghosts o now who will behold the royal captain of this ruind band walking from watch to watch from tent to tent let him cry praise and glory on his head for forth he goes and visits all his host bids them good morrow with a modest smile and calls them brothers friends and countrymen upon his royal face there is no note how dread an army hath enrounded him nor doth he dedicate one jot of colour unto the weary and allwatched night but freshly looks and overbears attaint with cheerful semblance and sweet majesty that every wretch pining and pale before beholding him plucks comfort from his looks a largess universal like the sun his liberal eye doth give to every one thawing cold fear that mean and gentle all behold as may unworthiness define a little touch of harry in the night and so our scene

to be otherwise gower why the enemy is loud you hear him all night fluellen if the enemy is an ass and a fool and a prating coxcomb is it meet think you that we should also look you be an ass and a

fashion there is much care and valour in this welshman enter three soldiers john bates alexander court and michael williams court brother john bates is not that the morning which breaks yonder bates i think it be but we have no great cause to desire the approach of day williams we see yonder the beginning of the day but i think we shall never see the end of it who goes there king henry a friend williams under what captain serve you king henry under sir thomas erpingham williams a good old commander and a most kind gentleman i pray you what thinks he of our estate king henry even as men wreckd upon a sand that look to be washd off the next tide bates he hath not told his thought to the king king henry no nor it is not meet he should for though i speak it to you i think the king is but a man as i am the violet smells to him as it doth to me the element shows to him as it doth to me all his senses have but human conditions his ceremonies laid by in his nakedness he appears but a man and though his affections are higher mounted than ours yet when they stoop they stoop with the like wing therefore when he sees reason of fears as we do his fears out of doubt be of the same relish as ours are yet in reason no man should possess him with any appearance of fear lest he by showing it should dishearten his army bates he may show what outward courage he will but i believe as cold a night as tis he could wish himself in thames up to the neck and so i would he were and i by him at all adventures so we were quit here king henry by my troth i will speak my conscience of the king i think he would not wish himself anywhere but where he is bates then i would he were here alone so should he be sure to be ransomed and a many poor mens lives saved king henry i dare say you love him not so ill to wish him here alone howsoever you speak this to feel other mens minds methinks i could not die anywhere so contented as in the kings company his cause being just and his quarrel honourable williams thats more than we know bates ay or more than we should seek after for we know enough if we know we are the kings subjects if his cause be wrong our obedience to the king wipes the crime of it out of us williams but if the cause be not good the king himself hath a heavy reckoning to make when all those legs and arms and heads choppd off in a battle shall join together at the latter day and cry all we died at such a place some swearing some crying for a surgeon some upon their wives left poor behind them some upon the debts they owe some upon their children rawly left i am afeard there are few die well that die in a battle for how can they charitably dispose of anything when blood is their argument now if these men do not die well it will be a black matter for the king that led them to it who to disobey were against all proportion of subjection king henry so if a son that is by his father sent about merchandise do sinfully miscarry upon the sea the imputation of his wickedness by your rule should be imposed upon his father that sent him or if a servant under his masters command transporting a sum of money be assailed by robbers and die in many irreconcild iniquities you may call the business of the master the author of the servants damnation but this is not so the king is not bound to answer the particular endings of his soldiers the father of his son nor the master of his servant for they purpose not their death when they purpose their services besides there is no king be his cause never so spotless if it come to the arbitrement of swords can try it out with all unspotted soldiers some peradventure have on them the guilt of premeditated and contrived murder some of beguiling virgins with the broken seals of perjury some making the wars their bulwark that have before gored the gentle bosom of peace with pillage and robbery now if these men have defeated the law and outrun native punishment though they can outstrip men they have no wings to fly from god war is his beadle war is his vengeance so that here men are punishd for beforebreach of the kings laws in now the kings quarrel where they feared the death they have borne life away and where they would be safe they perish then if they die unprovided no more is the king guilty of their damnation than he was before guilty of those impieties for the which they are now visited every subjects duty is the kings but every subjects soul is his own therefore should every soldier in the wars do as every sick man in his bed wash every mote out of his conscience and dying so death is to him advantage or not dying the time was blessedly lost wherein such preparation was gained and in him that escapes it were not sin to think that making god so free an offer he let him outlive that day to see his greatness and to teach others how they should prepare williams tis certain every man that dies ill the ill upon his own head the king is not to answer for it bates i do not desire he should answer for me and yet i determine to fight lustily for him king henry i myself heard the king say he would not be ransomd williams ay he said so to make us fight cheerfully but when our throats are cut he may be ransomd and we neer the wiser king henry if i live to see it i will never trust his word after williams you pay him then thats a perilous shot out of an eldergun that a poor and a private displeasure can do against a monarch you may as well go about to turn the sun to ice with fanning in his face with a peacocks feather youll never trust his word after come tis a foolish saying king henry your reproof is something too round i should be angry with you if the time were convenient williams let it be a quarrel between us if you live king henry i embrace it williams how shall i know thee again king henry give me any gage of thine and i will wear it in my bonnet then if ever thou darst acknowledge it i will make it my quarrel williams heres my glove give me another of thine king henry there williams this will i also wear in my cap if ever thou come to me and say after tomorrow this is my glove by this hand i will take thee a box on the ear king henry if ever i live to see it i will challenge it williams thou darst as well be hangd king henry well i will do it though i take thee in the kings company williams keep thy word fare thee well bates be friends you english fools be friends we have french quarrels enow if you could tell how to reckon king henry indeed the french may lay twenty french crowns to one they will beat us for they bear them on their shoulders but it is no english treason to cut french crowns and tomorrow the king himself will be a clipper exeunt soldiers upon the king let us our lives our souls our debts our careful wives our children and our sins lay on the king we must bear all o hard condition twinborn with greatness subject to the breath of every fool whose sense no more can feel but his own wringing what infinite hearts ease must

ceremony give thee cure thinks thou the fiery fever will go out with titles blown from adulation will it give place to flexure and low bending canst thou when thou commandst the beggars knee command

intertissued robe of gold and pearl the farced tide running fore the king the throne he sits on nor the tide of pomp that beats upon the high shore of this world no not all these thrice gorgeous

satisfied poor gentleman his wrong doth equal mine since henry monmouth first began to reign before whose glory i was great in arms this loathsome sequestration have i had and even since then hath richard been obscurd deprivd of honour and inheritance but now the arbitrator of despairs just death kind umpire of mens miseries with sweet enlargement doth dismiss me hence i would his troubles likewise were expird that so he might recover what was lost enter richard plantagenet first keeper my lord your loving nephew now is come mortimer richard plantagenet my friend is he come plantagenet

father earl of cambridge lost his head mortimer that cause fair nephew that imprisond me and hath detaind me all my flowring youth within a loathsome dungeon there to pine was cursed instrument of his decease plantagenet discover more at large what cause that was for i am ignorant and cannot guess mortimer i will if that my fading breath permit and death approach not ere my tale be done henry the fourth grandfather to this king deposd his nephew richard edwards son the firstbegotten and the lawful heir of edward king the third of that descent during whose reign the percies of the north finding his usurpation most unjust endeavourd my advancement to the throne the reason movd these warlike lords to this was for thatyoung richard thus removd leaving no heir begotten of his body i was the next by birth and parentage for by my mother i derived am from lionel duke of clarence third son to king edward the third whereas he from john of gaunt doth bring his pedigree being but fourth of that heroic line but mark as in this haughty great attempt they laboured to plant the rightful heir i lost my liberty and they their lives long after this when henry the fifth succeeding his father bolingbroke did reign thy father earl of cambridge then derivd from famous edmund langley duke of york marrying my sister that thy mother was again in pity of my hard distress levied an army weening

honour is the last mortimer true and thou seest that i no issue have and that my fainting words do warrant death thou art my heir the rest i wish thee gather but yet be wary in thy studious care plantagenet thy grave admonishments prevail with me but yet methinks my fathers execution was nothing less than bloody tyranny mortimer with silence nephew be thou politic strong fixed is the house of lancaster and like a mountain not to be removd but now thy uncle is removing hence as princes do their courts when they are cloyd with long continuance in a settled place plantagenet o uncle would some part of my young years might but redeem the passage of your age mortimer thou dost then wrong me as that slaughterer doth which giveth many wounds when one will kill mourn not except thou sorrow for my good only give order for my funeral and so farewell and fair be all thy hopes and prosperous be thy life in peace and war dies plantagenet and peace no war befall thy parting soul in prison hast thou spent a pilgrimage and like a hermit overpassd thy days well i will lock his counsel in my breast and what i do imagine let that rest keepers convey him hence and i myself will see his burial better than his life exeunt gaolers hearing out the body of mortimer here dies the dusky torch of mortimer chokd with ambition of the meaner sort and for those wrongs those bitter injuries

and the aspiring french and here at hand the dauphin and his train approacheth to confer about some matter york is all our travail turnd to this effect after the slaughter of so many peers so many captains gentlemen and soldiers that in this quarrel have been overthrown and sold their bodies for their countrys benefit shall we at last conclude effeminate peace have we not lost most part of all the towns by treason falsehood and by treachery our great progenitors had conquered o warwick warwick i foresee with grief the utter loss of all the realm of france warwick be patient york if we conclude a peace it shall be with such strict and severe covenants as little shall the frenchmen gain thereby enter charles alencon bastard reignier and others charles since lords of england it is thus agreed that peaceful truce shall be proclaimd in france we come to be informed by yourselves what the conditions of that league must be york speak winchester for boiling choler chokes the hollow passage of my poisond voice by sight of these our baleful enemies cardinal charles and the rest it is enacted thus that in regard king henry gives consent of mere compassion and of lenity to ease your country of distressful war an suffer you to breathe in fruitful peace you shall become true liegemen to his crown and charles upon condition thou wilt swear to pay him tribute and submit thyself thou shalt be placd as viceroy under him and still enjoy thy regal dignity alencon must he be then as shadow of himself adorn his temples with a coronet and yet in substance and authority retain but privilege of a private man this proffer is absurd and reasonless charles tis known already that i am possessd with more than half the gallian territories and therein reverencd for their lawful king shall i for lucre of the rest unvanquishd detract so much from that prerogative as to be calld but viceroy of the whole no lord ambassador ill rather keep that which i have than coveting for more be cast from possibility of all york insulting charles hast thou by secret means usd intercession to obtain a league and now the matter grows to compromise standst thou aloof upon comparison either accept the title thou usurpst of benefit proceeding from our king and not of any challenge of desert or we will plague thee with incessant wars reignier to charles my lord you do not well in obstinacy to cavil in the course of this contract if once it be neglected ten to one we shall not find like opportunity alencon to charles to say the truth it is your policy to save your subjects from such massacre and ruthless slaughters as are daily seen by our proceeding in hostility and therefore take this compact of a truce although you break it when your pleasure serves warwick how sayst thou charles shall our condition stand charles it shall only reservd you claim no interest in any of our towns of garrison york then swear allegiance to his majesty as thou art knight never to disobey nor be rebellious to the crown of england thou nor thy nobles to the crown of england charles and the rest give tokens of fealty so now dismiss your army when ye please hang up your ensigns let your drums be still for here we entertain a solemn peace exeunt scene london the palace enter suffolk in conference with the king gloucester and exeter king henry your wondrous rare description noble earl of beauteous margaret hath astonishd me her virtues graced with external gifts do breed loves settled passions in my heart and like as rigour of tempestuous gusts provokes the mightiest hulk against the tide so am i driven by breath of her renown either to suffer shipwreck or arrive where i may have fruition of her love suffolk tush my good lord this superficial tale is but a preface of her worthy praise the chief perfections of that lovely dame had i sufficient skill to utter them would make a volume of enticing lines able to ravish any dull conceit and which is more she is not so divine so fullreplete with choice of all delights but with as humble lowliness of mind she is content to be at your command command i mean of virtuous intents to love and honour henry as her lord king henry and otherwise will henry neer presume therefore my lord protector give consent that margaret may be englands royal queen gloucester so should i give consent to flatter sin you know my lord your highness is betrothd unto another lady of esteem how shall we then dispense with that contract and not deface your honour with reproach suffolk as doth a ruler with unlawful oaths or one that at a triumph having vowd to try his strength forsaketh yet the lists by reason of his adversarys odds a poor earls daughter is unequal odds and therefore may be broke without offence gloucester why what i pray is margaret more than that her father is no better than an earl although in glorious titles he excel suffolk yes my lord her father is a king the king of naples and jerusalem and of such great authority in france as his alliance will confirm our peace and keep the frenchmen in allegiance gloucester and so the earl of armagnac may do because he is near kinsman unto charles exeter beside his wealth doth warrant a liberal dower where reignier sooner will receive than give suffolk a dowr my lords disgrace not so your king that he should be so abject base and poor to choose for wealth and not for perfect love henry is able to enrich his queen and not to seek a queen to make him rich so worthless peasants bargain for their wives as marketmen for oxen sheep or horse marriage is a matter of more worth than to be dealt in by attorneyship not whom we will but whom his grace affects must be companion of his nuptial bed and therefore lords since he affects her most it most of all these reasons bindeth us in our opinions she should be preferrd for what is wedlock forced but a hell an age of discord and continual strife whereas the contrary bringeth bliss and is a pattern of celestial peace whom should we match with henry being a king but margaret that is daughter to a king her peerless feature joined with her birth approves her fit for none but for a king her valiant courage and undaunted spirit more than in women commonly is seen will answer our hope in issue of a king for henry son unto a conqueror is likely to beget more conquerors if with a lady of so high resolve as is fair margaret he be linkd in love then yield my lords and here conclude with me that margaret shall be queen and none but she king henry whether it be through force of your report my noble lord of suffolk or for that my tender youth was never yet attaint with any passion of inflaming love i cannot tell but this i am assurd i feel such sharp dissension in my breast such fierce alarums both of hope and fear as i am sick with working of my thoughts take therefore shipping post my lord to france agree to any covenants and procure that lady margaret do vouchsafe to come to cross the seas to england and be crownd king henrys faithful and anointed queen for your expenses and sufficient charge among the people gather up a tenth be gone i say for till you do return i rest perplexed with a thousand cares and you good uncle banish all offence if you do censure me by what you were not what you are i know it will excuse this sudden execution of my will and so conduct me where from company i may revolve and ruminate my grief exit gloucester ay grief i fear me both at first and last exeunt gloucester and exeter suffolk thus suffolk hath prevaild and thus he goes as did the youthful paris

france his true inheritance and did my brother bedford toil his wits to keep by policy what henry got have you yourselves somerset buckingham brave york salisbury and victorious warwick receivd deep scars in france and normandy or hath mine uncle beaufort and myself with all the learned council of the realm studied so long sat in the council house early and late debating to and fro how france and frenchmen might be kept in awe and had his highness in his infancy crowned in paris in despite of foes and shall these labours and these honours die shall henrys conquest bedfords vigilance your deeds of war and all our counsel die o peers of england shameful is this league fatal this marriage cancelling your fame blotting your names from books of memory razing the characters of your renown defacing monuments of conquerd france undoing all as all had never been cardinal nephew what means this passionate discourse this peroration with such circumstance for france tis ours and we will keep it still gloucester ay uncle we will keep it if we can but now it is impossible we should suffolk the newmade duke that rules the roast hath given the duchy of anjou and maine unto the poor king reignier whose large style agrees not with the leanness of his purse salisbury now by the death of him that died for all these counties were the keys of normandy but wherefore weeps warwick my valiant

these arms of mine did conquer and are the cities that i got with wounds deliverd up again with peaceful words mort dieu york for suffolks duke may he be suffocate that dims the honour of this warlike isle france should have torn and rent my very heart before i would have yielded to this league i never read but englands kings have had large sums of gold and dowries with their wives and our king henry gives away his own to match with her that brings no vantages gloucester a proper jest and never heard before that suffolk should demand a whole fifteenth for costs and charges in transporting her she should have stayd in france and starvd in france before cardinal my lord of gloucester now ye grow too hot it was the pleasure of my lord the king gloucester my lord of winchester i know your

good duke of gloucester clapping their hands and crying with loud voice jesu maintain your royal excellence with god preserve the good duke humphrey i fear me lords for all this flattering gloss he will be found a dangerous protector buckingham why should he then protect our sovereign he being of age to govern of himself cousin of somerset join you with me and all together with the duke of

pride and greatness of his place be grief to us yet let us watch the haughty cardinal his insolence is more intolerable than all the princes in the land beside if gloucester be displacd hell be protector buckingham or thou or i somerset will be protector despite duke humphrey or the cardinal exeunt buckingham and somerset salisbury pride went before ambition follows him while these do labour for their own preferment behoves it us to labour for the realm i never saw but humphrey duke of gloucester did bear him like a noble gentleman oft have i seen the haughty cardinal more like a soldier than a man o th church as stout and proud as he were lord of all swear like a ruffian and demean himself unlike the ruler of a commonweal warwick my son the comfort of my age thy deeds thy plainness and thy housekeeping hath won the greatest favour of the commons excepting none but good duke humphrey and brother york thy acts in ireland in bringing them to civil discipline thy late exploits done in the heart of france when thou wert regent for our sovereign have made thee feard and honourd of the people join we together for the public good in what we can to bridle and suppress the pride of suffolk and the cardinal with somersets and buckinghams ambition and as we may cherish duke humphreys deeds while they do tend the profit of the land warwick so god help warwick as he loves the land and common profit of his country york and so says york aside for he hath greatest cause salisbury then lets make haste away and look unto the main warwick unto the main o father maine is lost that maine which by main force warwick did win and would have kept so long as breath did last main chance father you meant but i meant maine which i will win from france or else be slain exeunt warwick and salisbury york anjou and maine are given to the french paris is lost the state of normandy stands on a tickle point now they are gone suffolk concluded on the articles the peers agreed and henry was well pleasd to changes two dukedoms for a dukes fair daughter i cannot blame them all what ist to them tis thine they give away and not their own pirates may make cheap pennyworths of their pillage and purchase friends and give to courtezans still revelling like lords till all be gone while as the silly owner of the goods weeps over them and wrings his hapless hands and shakes his head and trembling stands aloof while all is shard and all is borne away ready to starve and dare not touch his own so york must sit and fret and bite his tongue while his own lands are bargaind for and sold methinks the realms of england france and ireland bear that proportion to my flesh and blood as did the fatal brand althaea burnt unto the princes heart of calydon anjou and maine both given unto the french cold news for me for i had hope of france even as i have of fertile englands soil a day will come when york shall claim his own and therefore i will take the nevils parts and make a show of love to proud duke humphrey and when i spy advantage claim the crown for thats the golden mark i seek to hit nor shall proud lancaster usurp my right nor hold the sceptre in his childish fist nor wear the diadem upon his head whose churchlike humours fits not for a crown then york be still awhile till time do serve watch thou and wake when others be asleep to pry into the secrets of the state till henry surfeiting in joys of love with his new bride and englands dearbought queen and humphrey with the peers be falln at jars then will i raise aloft the milkwhite rose with whose sweet smell the air shall be perfumd and in my standard bear the arms of york to grapple with the house of lancaster and force perforce ill make him yield the crown whose bookish rule hath pulld fair england down exit

night doth make me sad duchess what dreamd my lord tell me and ill requite it with sweet rehearsal of my mornings dream gloucester methought this staff mine officebadge in court was broke in twain by whom i have forgot but as i think it was by th cardinal and on the pieces of the broken wand were placd the heads of edmund duke of somerset and william de la pole first duke of suffolk this was my dream what it doth bode god knows duchess tut this was nothing but an argument that he that breaks a stick of gloucesters grove shall lose his head for his presumption but list to me my humphrey my

seven sons the first edward the black prince prince of wales the second william of hatfield and the third lionel duke of clarence next to whom was john of gaunt the duke of lancaster the fifth was edmund langley duke of york the sixth was thomas of woodstock duke of gloucester william of windsor was the seventh and last edward the black prince died before his father and left behind him richard

realm deposd the rightful king sent his poor queen to france from whence she came and him to pomfret where as all you know harmless richard was murdered traitorously warwick father the duke hath told the truth thus got the house of lancaster the crown york which now they hold by force and not by right for richard the first sons heir being dead the issue of the next son should have reignd salisbury but william of hatfield died without an heir york the third son duke of clarence from whose line i claim the crown had issue philippe a daughter who married edmund mortimer earl of march edmund had issue roger earl of march roger had issue edmund anne and eleanor salisbury this edmund in the reign of bolingbroke as i have read laid claim unto the crown and but for owen glendower had been king

fifth son son by her i claim the kingdom she was heir to roger earl of march who was the son of edmund mortimer who married philippe sole daughter unto lionel duke of clarence so if the issue of the elder son succeed before the younger i am king warwick what plain proceedings is more plain than this henry doth claim the crown from john of gaunt the fourth son york claims it from the third till

suffolk york buckingham salisbury and warwick to the parliament king henry i muse my lord of gloucester is not come tis not his wont to be the hindmost man whateer occasion keeps him from us now queen can you not see or will ye not observe the strangeness of his alterd countenance with what a majesty he bears himself how insolent of late he is become how proud how peremptory and unlike himself we know the time since he was mild and affable and if we did but glance a faroff look immediately he was upon his knee that all the court admird him for submission but meet him now and be it in the morn when every one will give the time of day he knits his brow and shows an angry eye and passeth by with stiff unbowed knee disdaining duty that to us belongs small curs are not regarded when they grin but great men tremble when the lion roars and humphrey is no little man in england first note that he is near you in descent and should you fall he is the next will mount me seemeth then it is no policy respecting what a rancorous mind he bears and his advantage following your decease that he should come about your royal person or be admitted to your highness council by flattery hath he won the commons hearts and when he please to make commotion tis to be feard they all will follow him now tis the spring and weeds are shallowrooted suffer them now and theyll oergrow the garden and choke the herbs for want of husbandry the reverent care i bear unto my lord made me collect these dangers in the duke if it be fond can it a womans fear which fear if better reasons can supplant i will subscribe and say i wrongd the duke my lord of suffolk buckingham and york reprove my allegation if you can or else conclude my words effectual suffolk well hath your highness seen into this duke and had i first been put to speak my mind i think i should have told your graces tale the duchess by his subornation upon my life began her devilish practices or if he were not privy to those faults yet by reputing of his high descent as next the king he was successive heir and such high vaunts of his nobility did instigate the bedlam brainsick duchess by wicked means to frame our sovereigns fall smooth runs the water where the brook is deep and in his simple show he harbours treason the fox barks not when he would steal the lamb no no my sovereign gloucester is a man unsounded yet and full of deep deceit cardinal did he not contrary to form of law devise strange deaths for small offences done york and did he not in his protectorship levy great sums of money through the realm for soldiers pay in france and never sent it by means whereof the towns each day revolted buckingham tut these are petty faults to faults unknown which time will bring to light in smooth duke humphrey king henry my lords at once the care you have of us to mow down thorns that would annoy our foot is worthy praise but shall i speak my conscience our kinsman gloucester is as innocent from meaning treason to our royal person as is the sucking lamb or harmless dove the duke is virtuous mild and too well given to dream on evil or to work my downfall queen ah whats more dangerous than this fond affiance seems he a dove his feathers are but borrowd for hes disposed as the hateful raven is he a lamb his skin is surely lent him for hes inclind as is the ravenous wolf who cannot steal a shape that means deceit take heed my lord the welfare of us all hangs on the cutting short that fraudful man enter somerset somerset all health unto my gracious sovereign king henry welcome lord somerset what news from france somerset that all your interest in those territories is utterly bereft you all is lost king henry cold news lord somerset but gods will be done york aside cold news for me for i had hope of france as firmly as i hope for fertile england thus are my blossoms blasted in the bud and caterpillars eat my leaves away but i will remedy this gear ere long or sell my title for a glorious grave enter gloucester gloucester all happiness unto my lord the king pardon my liege that i have stayd so long suffolk nay gloucester know that thou art come too soon unless thou wert more loyal than thou art i do arrest thee of high treason here gloucester well suffolk thou shalt not see me blush nor change my countenance for this arrest a heart unspotted is not easily daunted the purest spring is not so free from mud as i am clear from treason to my sovereign who can accuse me wherein am i guilty york tis thought my lord that you took bribes of france and being protector stayd the soldiers pay by means whereof his highness hath lost france gloucester is it but thought so what are they that think it i never robbd the soldiers of their pay nor ever had one penny bribe from france so help me god as i have watchd the night ay night by night in studying good for england that doit that eer i wrested from the king or any groat i hoarded to my use be brought against me at my trialday no many a pound of mine own proper store because i would not tax the needy commons have i dispursed to the garrisons and never askd for restitution cardinal it serves you well my lord to say so much gloucester i say no more than truth so help me god york in your protectorship you did devise strange tortures for offenders never heard of that england was defamd by tyranny gloucester why tis well known that whiles i was protector pity was all the fault that was in me for i should melt at an offenders tears and lowly words were ransom for their fault unless it were a bloody murderer or foul felonious thief that fleecd poor passengers i never gave them condign punishment murder indeed that bloody sin i torturd above the felon or what trespass else suffolk my lord these faults are easy quickly answerd but mightier crimes are laid unto your charge whereof you cannot easily purge yourself i do arrest you in his highness name and here commit you to my lord cardinal to keep until your further time of trial king henry my lord of gloucester tis my special hope that you will clear yourself from all suspense my conscience tells me you are innocent gloucester ah gracious lord these days are dangerous virtue is chokd with foul ambition and charity chasd hence by rancours hand foul subornation is predominant and equity exild your highness land i know their complot is to have my life and if my death might make this island happy and prove the period of their tyranny i would expend it with all willingness but mine is made the prologue to their play for thousands more that yet suspect no peril will not conclude their plotted tragedy beauforts red sparkling eyes blab his hearts malice and suffolks cloudy brow his stormy hate sharp buckingham unburdens with his tongue the envious load that lies upon his heart and dogged york that reaches at the moon whose overweening arm i have pluckd back by false accuse doth level at my life and you my sovereign lady with the rest causeless have laid disgraces on my head and with your best endeavour have stirrd up my liefest liege to be mine enemy ay all of you have laid your heads together myself had notice of your conventicles and all to make away my guiltless life i shall not want false witness to condemn me nor store of treasons to augment my guilt the ancient proverb will be well effected a staff is quickly found to beat a dog cardinal my liege his railing is intolerable if those that care to keep your royal person from treasons secret knife and traitors rage be thus upbraided chid and rated at and the offender granted scope of speech twill make them cool in zeal unto your grace suffolk hath he not twit our sovereign lady here with ignominious words though clerkly couchd as if she had suborned some to swear false allegations to oerthrow his state queen but i can give the loser leave to chide gloucester far truer spoke than meant i lose indeed beshrew the winners for they playd me false and well such losers may have leave to speak buckingham hell wrest the sense and hold us here all day lord cardinal he is your prisoner cardinal sirs take away the duke and guard him sure gloucester ah thus king henry throws away his crutch before his legs be firm to bear his body thus is the shepherd beaten from thy side and wolves are gnarling who shall gnaw thee first ah that my fear were false ah that it were for good king henry thy decay i fear exit guarded king henry my lords what to your wisdoms seemeth best do or undo as if ourself were here queen what will your highness leave the parliament king henry ay margaret my heart is drownd with grief whose flood begins to flow within mine eyes my body round engirt with misery for whats more miserable than discontent ah uncle humphrey in thy face i see the map of honour truth and loyalty and yet good humphrey is the hour to come that eer i provd thee false or feard thy faith what louring star now envies thy estate that these great lords and margaret our queen do seek subversion of thy harmless life thou never didst them wrong nor no man wrong and as the butcher takes away the calf and binds the wretch and beats it when it strays bearing it to the bloody slaughterhouse even so remorseless have they borne him hence and as the dam runs lowing up and down looking the way her harmless young one went and can do nought but wail her darlings loss even so myself bewails good gloucesters case with sad unhelpful tears and with dimmd eyes look after him and cannot do him good so mighty are his vowed enemies his fortunes i will weep and twixt each groan say whos a traitor gloucester he is none exit queen free lords cold snow melts with the suns hot beams henry my lord is cold in great affairs too full of foolish pity and gloucesters show beguiles him as the mournful crocodile with sorrow snares relenting passengers or as the snake rolld in a flowring bank with shining checkerd slough doth sting a child that for the beauty thinks it excellent believe me lords were none more wise than i and yet herein i judge mine own wit good this gloucester should be quickly rid the world to rid us from the fear we have of him cardinal that he should die is worthy policy but yet we want a colour for his death tis meet he be condemnd by course of law suffolk but in my mind that were no policy the king will labour still to save his life the commons haply rise to save his life and yet we have but trivial argument more than mistrust that shows him worthy death york so that by this you would not have him die suffolk ah york no man alive so fain as i york tis york that hath more reason for his death but my lord cardinal and you my lord of suffolk say as you think and speak it from your souls weret not all one an empty eagle were set to guard the chicken from a hungry kite as place duke humphrey for the kings protector queen so the poor chicken should be sure of death suffolk madam tis true and weret not madness then to make the fox surveyor of the fold who being accusd a crafty murderer his guilt should be but idly posted over because his purpose is not executed no let him die in that he is a fox by nature provd an enemy to the flock before his chaps be staind with crimson blood as humphrey provd by reasons to my liege and do not stand on quillets how to slay him be it by gins by snares by subtlety sleeping or waking tis no matter how so he be dead for that is good deceit which mates him first that first intends deceit queen thricenoble suffolk tis resolutely spoke suffolk not resolute except so much were done for things are often spoke and seldom meant but that my heart accordeth with my tongue seeing the deed is meritorious and to preserve my sovereign from his foe say but the word and i will be his priest cardinal but i would have him dead my lord of suffolk ere you can take due orders for a priest say you consent and censure well the deed and ill provide his executioner i tender so the safety of my liege suffolk here is my hand the deed is worthy doing queen and so say i york and i and now we three have spoke it it skills not greatly who impugns our doom enter a post post great lords from ireland am i come amain to signify that rebels there are up and put the englishmen unto the sword send succours lords and stop the rage betime before the wound do grow uncurable for being green there is great hope of help cardinal a breach that craves a quick expedient stop what counsel give you in this weighty cause york that somerset be sent as regent thither tis meet that lucky ruler be employd witness the fortune he hath had in france somerset if york with all his farfet policy had been the regent there instead of me he never would have stayd in france so long york no not to lose it all as thou hast done i rather would have lost my life betimes than bring a burden of dishonour home by staying there so long till all were lost show me one scar characterd on thy skin mens flesh preservd so whole do seldom win queen nay then this spark will prove a raging fire if wind and fuel be brought to feed it with no more good york sweet somerset be still thy fortune york hadst thou been regent there might happily have provd far worse than his york what worse than nought nay then a shame take all somerset and in the number thee that wishest shame cardinal my lord of york try what your fortune is th uncivil kerns of ireland are in arms and temper clay with blood of englishmen to ireland will you lead a band of men collected choicely from each county some and try your hap against the irishmen york i will my lord so please his majesty suffolk why our authority is his consent and what we do establish he confirms then noble york take thou this task in hand york i am content provide me soldiers lords whiles i take order for mine own affairs suffolk a charge lord york that i will see performd but now return we to the false duke humphrey cardinal no more of him for i will deal with him that henceforth he shall trouble us no more and so break off the day is almost spent lord suffolk you and i must talk of that event york my lord of suffolk within fourteen days at bristol i expect my soldiers for there ill ship them all for ireland suffolk ill see it truly done my lord of york exeunt all but york york now york or never steel thy fearful thoughts and change misdoubt to resolution be that thou hopst to be or what thou art resign to death it is not worth th enjoying let palefacd fear keep with the meanborn man and find no harbour in a royal heart faster than springtime showrs comes thought on thought and not a thought but thinks on dignity my brain more busy than the labouring spider weaves tedious snares to trap mine enemies well nobles well tis politicly done to send me packing with an host of men i fear me you but warm the starved snake who cherishd in your breasts will sting your hearts twas men i lackd and you will give them me i take it kindly yet be well assurd you put sharp weapons in a madmans hands whiles i in ireland nourish a mighty band i will stir up in england some black storm shall blow ten thousand souls to heaven or hell and this fell tempest shall not cease to rage until the golden circuit on my head like to the glorious suns transparent beams do calm the fury of this madbred flaw and for a minister of my intent i have seducd a headstrong kentishman john cade of ashford to make commotion as full well he can under the tide of john mortimer in ireland have i seen this stubborn cade oppose himself against a troop of kerns and fought so long tiff that his thighs with darts were almost like a sharpquilld porpentine and in the end being rescud i have seen him caper upright like a wild morisco shaking the bloody darts as he his bells full often like a shaghaird crafty kern hath he conversed with the enemy and undiscoverd come to me again and given me notice of their villainies this devil here shall be my substitute for that john mortimer which now is dead in face in gait in speech he doth resemble by this i shall perceive the commons mind how they affect the house and claim of york say he be taken rackd and tortured i know no pain they can inflict upon him will make him say i movd him to those arms say that he thrive as tis great like he will why then from ireland come i with my strength and reap the harvest which that

serpents sting thou baleful messenger out of my sight upon thy eyeballs murderous tyranny sits in grim majesty to fright the world look not upon me for thine eyes are wounding yet do not go away come basilisk and kill the innocent gazer with thy sight for in the shade of death i shall find joy in life but double deathnow gloucesters dead queen why do you rate my lord of suffolk thus although the duke was enemy to him yet he most christianlike laments his death and for myself foe as he was to me might liquid tears or heartoffending groans or bloodconsuming sighs recall his life i would be blind with weeping sick with groans look pale as primrose with blooddrinking sighs and all to have the noble duke alive what know i how the world may deem of me for it is known we were but hollow friends it may be judgd i made the duke away so shall my name with slanders tongue be wounded and princes courts be filld with my reproach this get i by his death ay me unhappy to be a queen and crownd with infamy king henry ah woe is me for gloucester wretched man queen be woe for me more wretched than he is what dost thou turn away and hide thy face i am no loathsome leper look on me what

make my image but an alehouse sign was i for this nigh wreckd upon the sea and twice by awkward wind from englands bank drove back again unto my native clime what boded this but wellforewarning wind did seem to say seek not a scorpions nest nor set no footing on this unkind shore what did i then but cursd the gentle gusts and he that loosd them forth their brazen caves and bid them blow towards englands blessed shore or turn our stern upon a dreadful rock yet aeolus would not be a murderer but left that hateful office unto thee the prettyvaulting sea refusd to drown me knowing that thou wouldst have me drownd on shore with tears as salt as sea through thy unkindness the splitting rocks cowrd in the sinking sands and would not dash me with their ragged sides because thy flinty heart more hard than they might in thy palace perish margaret as far as i could ken thy chalky cliffs when from thy shore the tempest beat us back i stood upon the hatches in the storm and when the dusky sky began to rob my earnestgaping sight of thy lands view i took a costly jewel from my neck a heart it was bound in with diamonds and threw it towards thy land the sea receivd it and so i wishd thy body might my heart and even with this i lost fair englands view and bid mine eyes be packing with my heart and calld them blind and dusky spectacles for losing ken of albions wished coast how often have i tempted suffolks tongue the agent of thy foul inconstancy to sit and witch me as ascanius did when he to madding dido would unfold his fathers acts commencd in burning troy am i not witchd like

king henry o thou that judgest all things stay my thoughts my thoughts that labour to persuade my soul some violent hands were laid on humphreys life if my suspect be false forgive me god for judgment only doth belong to thee fain would i go to chafe his paly lips with twenty thousand kisses and to drain upon his face an ocean of salt tears to tell my love unto his dumb deaf trunk and with my fingers feel his hand unfeeling but all in vain are these mean obsequies and to survey his dead and earthy image what were it but to make my sorrow greater bed put forth with the body enter warwick warwick come hither gracious sovereign view this body king henry that is to see how deep my grave is made for with his soul fled all my worldly solace for seeing him i see my life in death warwick as surely as my soul intends to live with that dread king that took our state upon him to free us from his fathers wrathful curse i do believe that violent hands were laid upon the life of this thricefamed duke suffolk a dreadful oath sworn with a solemn tongue what instance gives lord warwick for his vow warwick see how the blood is settled in his face oft have i seen a timelyparted ghost of ashy semblance meagre pale and bloodless being all descended to the labouring heart who in the conflict that it holds with death attracts the same for aidance gainst the enemy which with the heart there cools and neer returneth to blush and beautify the cheek again but see his face is black and full of blood his eyeballs further out than when he livd staring full ghastly like a strangled man his hair upreard his nostrils stretchd with struggling his hands abroad displayd as one that graspd and tuggd for life and was by strength subdud look on the sheets his hair you see is sticking his wellproportiond beard made rough and rugged like to the summers corn by tempest lodged it cannot be but he was murdred here the least of all these signs were probable suffolk why warwick who should do the duke to death myself and beaufort had him in protection and we i hope sir are no murderers warwick but both of you were vowd duke humphreys foes and you forsooth had the good duke to keep tis like you would not feast him like a friend and tis well seen he found an enemy queen then you belike suspect these noblemen as guilty of duke humphreys timeless death warwick who finds the heifer dead and bleeding fresh and sees fast by a butcher with an axe but will suspect twas he that made the slaughter who finds the partridge in the puttocks nest but may imagine how the bird was dead although the kite soar with unbloodied beak even so suspicious is this tragedy queen are you the butcher suffolk wheres your knife is beaufort termd a kite where are his talons suffolk i wear no knife to slaughter

controller though suffolk dare him twenty thousand times warwick madam be still with reverence may i say for every word you speak in his behalf is slander to your royal dignity suffolk bluntwitted lord ignoble in demeanour if ever lady wrongd her lord so much thy mother took into her blameful bed some stern untutord churl and noble stock was graft with crabtree slip whose fruit thou art and never of the nevils noble race warwick but that the guilt of murder bucklers thee and i should rob the deathsman of his fee quitting thee thereby of ten thousand shames and that my sovereigns presence makes me mild i would false murdrous coward on thy knee make thee beg pardon for thy passed speech and say it was thy mother that thou meantst that thou thyself was born in bastardy and after all this fearful homage done give thee thy hire and send thy soul to hell pernicious bloodsucker of sleeping men suffolk thou shalt be waking while i shed thy blood if from this presence thou darst go with me

word by me unless lord suffolk straight be done to death or banished fair englands territories they will by violence tear him from your palace and torture him with grievous lingring death they say by him the good duke humphrey died they say in him they fear your highness death and mere instinct of love and loyalty free from a stubborn opposite intent as being thought to contradict your liking makes them thus forward in his banishment they say in care of your most royal person that if your highness should intend to sleep and charge that no man should disturb your rest in pain of your dislike or pain of death yet notwithstanding such a strait edict were there a serpent seen with forked tongue that slily glided towards your majesty it were but necessary you were wakd lest being sufferd in that harmful slumber the mortal worm might make the sleep eternal and therefore do they cry though you forbid that they will guard you wheer you will or no from such fell serpents as false suffolk is with whose envenomed and fatal sting your loving uncle twenty times his worth they say is shamefully bereft of life commons within an answer from the king my lord of salisbury suffolk tis like the commons rude unpolishd hinds could send such message to their sovereign but you my lord were glad to be employd to show how quaint an orator you are but all the honour salisbury hath won is that he was the lord ambassador sent from a sort of tinkers to the king commons within an answer from the king or we will all break in king henry go salisbury and tell them all from me i thank them for their tender loving care and had i not been cited so by them yet did i purpose as they do entreat for sure my thoughts do hourly prophesy mischance unto my state by suffolks means and therefore by

king henry ungentle queen to call him gentle suffolk no more i say if thou dost plead for him thou wilt but add increase unto my wrath had i but said i would have kept my word but when i swear it is

spirit to curse thine enemy suffolk a plague upon them wherefore should i curse them would curses kill as doth the mandrakes groan i would invent as bitter searching terms as curst as harsh and horrible to hear deliverd strongly through my fixed teeth with full as many signs of deadly hate as leanfacd envy in her loathsome cave my tongue should stumble in mine earnest words mine eyes should sparkle like the beaten flint mine hair be fixd an end as one distract ay every joint should seem to curse and ban and even now my burdend heart would break should i not curse them poison be their drink gall worse than gall the daintiest that they taste their sweetest shade a grove of cypress trees their chiefest prospect murdring basilisks their softest touch as smart as lizards stings their music frightful as the serpents hiss and boding screechowls make the consort full all the foul terrors in darkseated hell queen enough sweet suffolk thou tormentst thyself and these dread curses like the sun gainst glass or like an overcharged gun recoil and turns the force of them upon thyself suffolk you bade me ban and will you bid me leave now by the ground that i am banishd from well could i

thee whence thou camst of whom derivd were shame enough to shame thee wert thou not shameless thy father bears the type of king of naples of both the sicils and jerusalem yet not so wealthy as an english yeoman hath that poor monarch taught thee to insult it needs not nor it boots thee not proud queen unless the adage must be verified that beggars mounted run their horse to death tis beauty

the want thereof makes thee abominable thou art as opposite to every good as the antipodes are unto us or as the south to the septentrion o tigers heart wrappd in a womans hide how couldst thou drain the lifeblood of the child to bid the father wipe his eyes withal and yet be seen to bear a womans face women are soft mild pitiful and flexible thou stern obdurate flinty rough remorseless bidst thou me rage why now thou hast thy wish wouldst have me weep why now thou hast thy will for raging wind blows up incessant showers and when the rage allays the rain begins these tears are my sweet rutlands obsequies and every drop cries vengeance for his death gainst thee fell clifford and thee false frenchwoman northumberland beshrew me but his passions move me so that hardly can i check my eyes from

in the thickest troop as doth a lion in a herd of neat or as a bear encompassd round with dogs who having pinchd a few and made them cry the rest stand all aloof and bark at him so fard our father with his enemies so fled his enemies my warlike father methinks tis prize enough to be his son see how the morning opes her golden gates and takes her farewell of the glorious sun how well resembles it the prime of youth trimmd like a younker prancing to his love edward dazzle mine eyes or do i see three suns richard three glorious suns each one a perfect sun not separated with the racking clouds

a little axe hews down and fells the hardesttimberd oak by many hands your father was subdud but only slaughtred by the ireful arm of unrelenting clifford and the queen who crownd the gracious duke in high despite laughd in his face and when with grief he wept the ruthless queen gave him to dry his cheeks a napkin steeped in the harmless blood of sweet young rutland by rough clifford slain and after many scorns many foul taunts they took his head and on the gates of york they set the same and there it doth remain the saddest spectacle that eer i viewd edward sweet duke of york our prop to lean upon now thou art gone we have no staff no stay o clifford boistrous clifford thou hast slain the flowr of europe for his chivalry and treacherously hast thou vanquishd him for hand to hand he

lord clifford done to death warwick ten days ago i drownd these news in tears and now to add more measure to your woes i come to tell you things sith then befalln after the bloody fray at wakefield fought where your brave father breathd his latest gasp tidings as swiftly as the posts could run were brought me of your loss and his depart i then in london keeper of the king musterd my soldiers gathered flocks of friends and very well appointed as i thought marchd toward saint albans to intercept the queen bearing the king in my behalf along for by my scouts i was advertised that she was coming with a full intent to dash our late decree in parliament touching king henrys oath and your succession short tale to make we at saint albans met our battles joind and both sides fiercely fought but whether twas the coldness of the king who lookd full gently on his warlike queen that robbd my soldiers of their heated spleen or whether twas report of her success or more than common fear of cliffords rigour who thunders to his captives blood and death i cannot judge but to conclude with truth their weapons like to lightning came and went our soldiers like the nightowls lazy flight or like an idle thresher with a flail fell gently down as if they struck their friends i cheerd them up with justice of our cause with promise of high pay and great rewards but all in vain they had no heart to fight and we in them no hope to win the day so that we fled the king unto the queen lord george your brother norfolk and myself in haste posthaste are come to join with you for in the marches here we heard you were making another head to fight again edward where is the duke of norfolk gentle warwick and when came george from burgundy to england warwick some six miles off the duke is with

bear thy glories makes me speak but in this troublous time whats to be done shall we go throw away our coats of steel and wrap our bodies in black mourninggowns numbering our avemaries with our beads

montague attend me lords the proud insulting queen with clifford and the haught northumberland and of their feather many moe proud birds have wrought the easymelting king like wax he swore consent to your succession his oath enrolled in the parliament and now to london all the crew are gone to frustrate both his oath and what beside may make against the house of lancaster their power i think is thirty thousand strong now if the help of norfolk and myself with all the friends that thou brave earl of march amongst the loving welshmen canst procure will but amount to five and twenty thousand why via to london will we march amain and once again bestride our foaming steeds and once again cry charge upon our foes but never once again turn back and fly richard ay now methinks i hear great warwick speak neer may he live to see a sunshine day that cries retire if warwick bid him stay edward lord warwick on thy shoulder will i lean and when thou failst as god forbid the hour must edward

now hath done his shrift clarence when he was made a shriver twas for shrift king edward brothers you muse what chat we two have had gloucester the widow likes it not for she looks very sad king edward youd think it strange if i should marry her clarence to who my lord king edward why clarence to myself gloucester that would be ten days wonder at the least clarence thats a day longer than a wonder lasts gloucester by so much is the wonder in extremes king edward well jest on brothers i can tell you both her suit is granted for her husbands lands enter a nobleman nobleman my gracious lord henry your foe is taken and brought your prisoner to your palace gate king edward see that he be conveyd unto the tower and go we brothers to the man that took him to question of his apprehension widow go you along lords use her honourably exeunt all but gloucester gloucester ay edward will use women honourably would he were wasted marrow bones and all that from his loins no hopeful branch may spring to cross me from the golden time i look for and yet between my souls desire and me the lustful edwards title buried is clarence henry and his son young edward and all the unlookd for issue of their bodies to take their rooms ere i can place myself a cold premeditation for my purpose why then i do but dream on sovereignty like one that stands upon a promontory and spies a faroff shore where he would tread wishing his foot were equal with his eye and chides the sea that sunders him from thence saying hell lade it dry to have his way so do i wish the crown being so far off and so i chide the means that keeps me from it and so i say ill cut the causes off flattering me with impossibilities my eyes too quick my heart oerweens too much unless my hand and strength could equal them well say there is no kingdom then for richard what other pleasure can the world afford ill make my heaven in a ladys lap and deck my body in gay ornaments and witch sweet ladies with my words and looks o miserable thought and more unlikely than to accomplish twenty golden crowns why love forswore me in my mothers womb and for i should not deal in her soft laws she did corrupt frail nature with some bribe to shrink mine arm up like a witherd shrub to make an envious mountain on my back where sits deformity to mock my body to shape my legs of an unequal size to disproportion me in every part like to a chaos or an unlickd bearwhelp that carries no impression like the dam and am i then a man to be belovd o monstrous fault to harbour such a thought then since this earth affords no joy to me but to command to check to oerbear such as are of better person than myself ill make my heaven to dream upon the crown and whiles i live t account this world but hell until my misshapd trunk that bear this head be round impaled with a glorious crown and yet i know not how to get the crown for many lives stand between me and home and i like one lost in a thorny wood that rents the thorns and is rent with the thorns seeking a way and straying from the way not knowing how to find the open air but toiling desperately to find it out torment myself to catch the english crown and from that torment i will free myself or hew my way out with a bloody axe why i can smile and murder whiles i smile and cry content to that which grieves my heart and wet my cheeks with artificial tears and frame my face to all occasions ill drown more sailors than the mermaid shall ill slay more gazers than the basilisk ill play the orator as well as nestor deceive more slily than ulysses could and like a sinon take another troy i can add colours to the chameleon change shapes with protheus for advantages and set the murderous machiavel to school can i do this and cannot get a crown tut were it farther off ill pluck it down exit scene iii france the kings palace flourish enter lewis the french king his sister bona his admiral calld bourbon prince edward queen margaret and the earl of oxford lewis sits and riseth up again lewis fair queen of england worthy margaret sit down with us it ill befits thy state and birth that thou shouldst stand while lewis doth sit queen margaret no mighty king of france now margaret must strike her sail and learn a while to serve where kings command i was i must confess great albions queen in former golden days but now mischance hath trod my title down and with dishonour laid me on the ground where i must take like seat unto my fortune and to my humble seat conform myself lewis why say fair queen whence springs this deep despair queen margaret from such a cause as fills mine eyes with tears and stops my tongue while heart is drownd in cares lewis whateer it be be thou still like thyself and sit thee by our side seats her by him yield not thy neck to fortunes yoke but let thy dauntless mind still ride in triumph over all mischance be plain queen margaret and tell thy grief it shall be easd if france can yield relief queen margaret those gracious words revive my drooping thoughts and give my tonguetied sorrows leave to speak now therefore be it known to noble lewis that henry sole possessor of my love is of a king become a banishd man and forcd to live in scotland a forlorn while proud ambitious edward duke of york usurps the regal title and the seat of englands trueanointed lawful king this is the cause that i poor margaret with this my son prince edward henrys heir am come to crave thy just and lawful aid and if thou fail us all our hope is done scotland hath will to help but cannot help our people and our peers are both misled our treasure seizd our soldiers put to flight and as thou seest ourselves in heavy plight lewis renowned queen with patience calm the storm while we bethink a means to break it off queen margaret the more we stay the stronger grows our foe lewis the more i stay the more ill succour thee queen margaret o but impatience waiteth on true sorrow and see where comes the breeder of my sorrow enter warwick lewis whats he approacheth boldly to our presence queen margaret our earl of warwick edwards greatest friend lewis welcome brave warwick what brings thee to france he descends she ariseth queen margaret ay now begins a second storm to rise for this is he that moves both wind and tide warwick from worthy edward king of albion my lord and sovereign and thy vowed friend i come in kindness and unfeigned love first to do greetings to thy royal person and then to crave a league of amity and lastly to confirm that amity with nuptial knot if thou vouchsafe to grant that virtuous lady bona thy fair sister to englands king in lawful marriage queen margaret aside if that go forward henrys hope is done warwick to bona and gracious madam in our kings behalf i am commanded with your leave and favour humbly to kiss your hand and with my tongue to tell the passion of my sovereigns heart where fame late entring at his heedful ears hath placd thy beautys image and thy virtue queen margaret king lewis and lady bona hear me speak before you answer warwick his demand springs not from edwards wellmeant honest love but from deceit bred by necessity for how can tyrants safely govern home unless abroad they purchase great alliance to prove him tyrant this reason may suffice that henry liveth still but were he dead yet here prince edward stands king henrys son look therefore lewis that by this league and marriage thou draw not on thy danger and dishonour for though usurpers sway the rule a while yet heavns are just and time suppresseth wrongs warwick injurious margaret prince of wales and why not queen warwick because thy father henry did usurp and thou no more art prince than she is queen oxford then warwick disannuls great john of gaunt which did subdue the greatest part of spain and after john of gaunt henry the fourth whose wisdom was a mirror to the wisest and after that wise prince henry the fifth who by his prowess conquered all france from these our henry lineally descends warwick oxford how haps it in this smooth discourse you told not how henry the sixth hath lost all that which henry the fifth had gotten methinks these peers of france should smile at that but for the rest you tell a pedigree of threescore and two years a silly time to make prescription for a kingdoms worth oxford why warwick canst thou speak against thy liege whom thou obeyedst thirty and six years and not betray thy treason with a blush warwick can oxford that did ever fence the right now buckler falsehood with a pedigree for shame leave henry and call edward king oxford call him my king by whose injurious doom my elder brother the lord aubrey vere was done to death and more than so my father even in the downfall of his mellowd years when nature brought him to the door of death no warwick no while life upholds this arm this arm upholds the house of lancaster warwick and i the house of york lewis queen margaret prince edward and oxford vouchsafe at our request to stand aside while i use further conference with warwick they stand aloof queen margaret heavens grant that warwicks words bewitch him not lewis now warwick tell me even upon thy conscience is edward your true king for i were loath to link with him that were not lawful chosen warwick thereon i pawn my credit and mine honour lewis but is he gracious in the peoples eye warwick the more that henry was unfortunate lewis then further all dissembling set aside tell me for truth the measure of his love unto our sister bona warwick such it seems as may beseem a monarch like himself myself have often heard him say and swear that this his love was an eternal plant whereof the root was fixd in virtues ground the leaves and fruit maintaind with beautys sun exempt from envy but not from disdain unless the lady bona quit his pain lewis now sister let us hear your firm resolve bona your grant or your denial shall be mine to warwick yet i confess that often ere this day when i have heard your kings desert recounted mine ear hath tempted judgment to desire lewis then warwick thus our sister shall be edwards and now forthwith shall articles be drawn touching the jointure that your king must make which with her dowry shall be counterpoisd draw near queen margaret and be a witness that bona shall be wife to the english king prince of wales to edward but not to the english king queen margaret deceitful warwick it was thy device by this alliance to make void my suit before thy coming lewis was henrys friend lewis and still is friend to him and margaret but if your title to the crown be weak as may appear by edwards good success then tis but reason that i be releasd from giving aid which late i promised yet shall you have all kindness at my hand that your estate requires and mine can yield warwick henry now lives in scotland at his case where having nothing nothing can he lose and as for you yourself our quondam queen you have a father able to maintain you and better twere you troubled him than france queen margaret peace impudent and shameless warwick proud setter up and puller down of kings i will not hence till with my talk and tears both full of truth i make king lewis behold thy sly conveyance and thy lords false love for both of you are birds of selfsame feather post blowing a horn within lewis warwick this is some post to us or thee enter the post post my lord ambassador these letters are for you sent from your brother marquis montague these from our king unto your majesty and madam these for you from whom i know not they all read their letters oxford i like it well that our fair queen and mistress smiles at her news while warwick frowns at his prince of wales nay mark how lewis stamps as he were nettled i hope alls for the best lewis warwick what are thy news and yours fair queen queen margaret mine such as fill my heart with unhopd joys warwick mine full of sorrow and hearts discontent lewis what has your king married the lady grey and now to soothe your forgery and his sends me a paper to persuade me patience is this th alliance that he seeks with france dare he presume to scorn us in this manner queen margaret i told your majesty as much before this proveth edwards love and warwicks honesty warwick king lewis i here protest in sight of heaven and by the hope i have of heavenly bliss that i am clear from this misdeed of edwards no more my king for he dishonours me but most himself if he could see his shame did i forget that by the house of york my father came untimely to his death did i let pass th abuse done to my niece did i impale him with the regal crown did i put henry from his native right and am i guerdond at the last with shame shame on himself for my desert is honour and to repair my honour lost for him i here renounce him and return to henry my noble queen let former grudges pass and henceforth i am thy true servitor i will revenge his wrong to lady bona and replant henry in his former state queen margaret warwick these words have turnd my hate to love and i forgive and quite forget old faults and joy that thou becomst king henrys friend warwick so much his friend ay his unfeigned friend that if king lewis vouchsafe to furnish us with some few bands of chosen soldiers ill undertake to land them on our coast and force the tyrant from his seat by war tis not his newmade bride shall succour him and as for clarence as my letters tell me hes very likely now to fall from him for matching more for wanton lust than honour or than for strength and safety of our country bona dear brother how shall bona be revengd but by thy help to this distressed queen queen margaret renowned prince how shall poor henry live unless thou rescue him from foul despair bona my quarrel and this english queens are one warwick and mine fair lady bona joins with yours lewis and mine with hers and thine and margarets therefore at last i firmly am resolvd you shall have aid queen margaret let me give humble thanks for all at once lewis then englands messenger return in post and tell false edward thy supposed king that lewis of france is sending over masquers to revel it with him and his new bride thou seest whats past go fear thy king withal bona tell him in hope hell prove a widower shortly ill wear the willowgarland for his sake queen margaret tell him my mourning weeds are laid aside and i am ready to put armour on warwick tell him from me that he hath done me wrong and therefore ill uncrown him eret be long theres thy reward be gone exit post lewis but warwick thou and oxford with five thousand men shall cross the seas and bid false edward battle and as occasion serves this noble queen and prince shall follow with a fresh supply yet ere thou go but answer me one doubt what pledge have we of thy firm loyalty warwick this shall assure my constant loyalty that if our queen and this young prince agree ill join mine eldest daughter and my joy to him forthwith in holy wedlock bands queen margaret yes i agree and thank you for your motion son edward she is fair and virtuous therefore delay not give thy hand to warwick and with thy hand thy faith irrevocable that only warwicks daughter shall be thine prince of wales yes i accept her for she well deserves it and here to pledge my vow i give my hand he gives his hand to warwick lewis stay we now these soldiers shall be levied and thou lord bourbon our high admiral shall waft them over with our royal fleet i long till edward fall by wars mischance for mocking marriage with a dame of france exeunt all but warwick warwick i came from edward as ambassador but i return his sworn and mortal foe matter of marriage was the charge he gave me but dreadful war shall answer his demand had he none else to make a stale but me then none but i shall turn his jest to sorrow i was the chief that raisd him to the crown and ill be chief to bring him down again not that i pity henrys misery but seek revenge on edwards mockery exit act iv scene i london the palace enter gloucester clarence somerset and montague gloucester now tell me brother clarence what think you of this new marriage with the lady grey hath not our brother made a worthy choice clarence alas you know tis far from hence to france how could he stay till warwick made return somerset my lords forbear this talk here comes the king flourish enter king edward attended lady grey as queen pembroke stafford hastings and others four stand on one side and four on the other gloucester and his wellchosen bride clarence i mind to tell him plainly what i think king edward now brother of clarence how like you our choice that you stand pensive as half malcontent clarence as well as lewis of france or the earl of warwick which are so weak of courage and in judgment that theyll take no offence at our abuse king edward suppose they take offence without a cause they are but lewis and warwick i am edward your king and warwicks and must have my will gloucester and shall have your will because our king yet hasty marriage seldom proveth well king edward yea brother richard are you offended too gloucester not i no god forbid that i should wish them severd whom god hath joind together ay and twere pity to sunder them that yoke so well together king edward setting your scorns and your mislike aside tell me some reason why the lady grey should not become my wife and englands queen and you too somerset and montague speak freely what you think clarence then this is mine opinion that king lewis becomes your enemy for mocking him about the marriage of the lady bona gloucester and warwick doing what you gave in charge is now dishonoured by this new marriage king edward what if both lewis and warwick be appeasd by such invention as i can devise montague yet to have joind with france in such alliance would more have strengthned this our commonwealth gainst foreign storms than any homebred marriage hastings why knows not montague that of itself england is safe if true within itself montague but the safer when tis backd with france hastings tis better using france than trusting france let us be backd with god and with the seas which he hath givn for fence impregnable and with their helps only defend ourselves in them and in ourselves our safety lies clarence for this one speech lord hastings well deserves to have the heir of the lord hungerford king edward ay what of that it was my will and grant and for this once my will shall stand for law gloucester and yet methinks your grace hath not done well to give the heir and daughter of lord scales unto the brother of your loving bride she better would have fitted me or clarence but in your bride you bury brotherhood clarence or else you would not have bestowd the heir of the lord bonville on your new wifes son and leave your brothers to go speed elsewhere king edward alas poor clarence is it for a wife that thou art malcontent i will provide thee clarence in choosing for yourself you showd your judgment which being shallow you shall give me leave to play the broker in mine own behalf and to that end i shortly mind to leave you king edward leave me or tarry edward will be king and not be tied unto his brothers will queen elizabeth my lords before it pleasd his majesty to raise my state to title of a queen do me but right and you must all confess that i was not ignoble of descent and meaner than myself have had like fortune but as this title honours me and mine so your dislikes to whom i would be pleasing doth cloud my joys with danger and with sorrow king edward my love forbear to fawn upon their frowns what danger or what sorrow can befall thee so long as edward is thy constant friend and their true sovereign whom they must obey nay whom they shall obey and love thee too unless they seek for hatred at my hands which if they do yet will i keep thee safe and they shall feel the vengeance of my wrath gloucester aside i hear yet say not much but think the more enter a post king edward now messenger what letters or what news from france messenger my sovereign liege no letters and few words but such as i without your special pardon dare not relate king edward go to we pardon thee therefore in brief tell me their words as near as thou canst guess them what answer makes king lewis unto our letters messenger at my depart these were his very words go tell false edward the supposed king that lewis of france is sending over masquers to revel it with him and his new bride king edward is lewis so brave belike he thinks me henry but what said lady bona to my marriage messenger these were her words uttred with mild disdain tell him in hope hell prove a widower shortly ill wear the willowgarland for his sake king edward i blame not her she could say little less she had the wrong but what said henrys queen for i have heard that she was there in place messenger tell him quoth she my mourning weeds are done and i am ready to put armour on king edward belike she minds to play the amazon but what said warwick to these injuries messenger he more incensd against your majesty than all the rest dischargd me with these words tell him from me that he hath done me wrong and therefore ill uncrown him eret be long king edward ha durst the traitor breathe out so proud words well i will arm me being thus forewarnd they shall have wars and pay for their presumption but say is warwick friends with margaret messenger ay gracious sovereign they are so linkd in friendship that young prince edward marries warwicks daughter clarence belike the elder clarence will have the younger now brother king farewell and sit you fast for i will hence to warwicks other daughter that though i want a kingdom yet in marriage i may not prove inferior to yourself you that love me and warwick follow me exit and somerset follows gloucester aside not i my thoughts aim at a further matter i stay not for the love of edward but the crown king edward clarence and somerset both gone to warwick yet am i armd against the worst can happen and haste is needful in this desprate case pembroke and stafford you in our behalf go levy men and make prepare for war they are already or quickly will be landed myself in person will straight follow you exeunt pembroke and stafford but ere i go hastings and montague resolve my doubt you twain of all the rest are near to warwick by blood and by alliance tell me if you love warwick more than me if it be so then both depart to him i rather wish you foes than hollow friends but if you mind to hold your true obedience give me assurance with some friendly vow that i may never have you in suspect montague so god help montague as he proves true hastings and hastings as he favours edwards cause king edward now brother richard will you stand by us gloucester ay in despite of all that shall withstand you king edward why so then am i sure of victory now therefore let us hence and lose no hour till we meet warwick with his foreign powr exeunt scene ii a plain in warwickshire enter warwick and oxford with french soldiers warwick trust me my lord all hitherto goes well the common people by numbers swarm to us enter clarence and somerset but see where somerset and clarence comes speak suddenly my lords are we all friends clarence fear not that my lord warwick then gentle clarence welcome unto warwick and welcome somerset i hold it cowardice to rest mistrustful where a noble heart hath pawnd an open hand in sign of love else might i think that clarence edwards brother were but a feigned friend to our proceedings but welcome sweet clarence my daughter shall be thine and now what rests but in nights coverture thy brother being carelessly encampd his soldiers lurking in the towns about and but attended by a simple guard we may surprise and take him at our pleasure our scouts have found the adventure very easy that as ulysses and stout diomede with sleight and manhood stole to rhesus tents and brought from thence the thracian fatal steeds so we well coverd with the nights black mantle at unawares may beat down edwards guard and seize himself i say not slaughter him for i intend but only

since a fresh admirer of what i saw there buckingham an untimely ague stayd me a prisoner in my chamber when those suns of glory those two lights of men met in the vale of andren norfolk twixt guynes and arde i was then present saw them salute on horseback beheld them when they lighted how they clung in their embracement as they grew together which had they what four thrond ones could have weighd such a compounded one buckingham all the whole time i was my chambers prisoner norfolk then you lost the view of earthly glory men might say till this time pomp was single but now married to one above itself each following day became the next days master till the last made former wonders its today the french all clinquant all in gold like heathen gods shone down the english and tomorrow they made britain india every man that stood showd like a mine their dwarfish pages were as cherubins an gilt the madams too not usd to toil did almost sweat to bear the pride upon them that their very labour

spirits to arms they did perform beyond thoughts compass that former fabulous story being now seen possible enough got credit that bevis was believd buckingham o you go far norfolk as i belong to

each thing view the office did distinctly his full function buckingham who did guide i mean who set the body and the limbs of this great sport together as you guess norfolk one certes that promises no element in such a business buckingham i pray you who my lord norfolk all this was ordred by the good discretion of the right reverend cardinal of york buckingham the devil speed him no mans pie is freed from his ambitious finger what had he to do in these fierce vanities i wonder that such a keech can with his very bulk take up the rays o th beneficial sun and keep it from the earth norfolk surely sir theres in him stuff that puts him to these ends for being not proppd by ancestry whose grace chalks successors their way nor calld upon for high feats done to th crown neither allied to eminent assistants but spiderlike out of his selfdrawing web a gives us note the force of his own merit makes his way a gift that heaven gives for him which buys a place next to the king abergavenny i cannot tell what heaven hath given himlet some graver eye pierce into that but i can see his pride peep through each part of him whence has he that if not from hell the devil is a niggard or has given all before and he begins a new hell in himself buckingham why the devil upon this french going out took he upon him without the privity o th kingt appoint who should attend on him he makes up the file of all the gentry for the most part such to whom as great a charge as little honour he meant to lay upon and his own letter the honourable board of council out must fetch him in he papers abergavenny i do know kinsmen of mine three at the least that have by this so sickend their estates that never they shall abound as formerly buckingham o many have broke their backs with laying manors on em for this great journey what did this vanity but minister communication of a most poor issue norfolk grievingly i think the peace between the french and us not values the cost that did conclude it buckingham every man after the hideous storm that followd was a thing inspird and not consulting broke into a general prophecythat this tempest dashing the garment of this peace aboded the sudden breach ont norfolk which is budded out for france hath flawd the league and hath attachd our merchants goods at bordeaux abergavenny is it therefore th ambassador is silencd norfolk marry ist abergavenny a proper tide of a peace and purchasd at a superfluous rate buckingham why all this business our reverend cardinal carried norfolk like it your grace the state takes notice of the private difference betwixt you and the cardinal i advise you and take it from a heart that wishes towards you honour and plenteous safetythat you read the cardinals malice and his potency together to consider further that what his high hatred would effect wants not a minister in his power you know his nature that hes revengeful and i know his sword hath a sharp edgeits long andt may be said it reaches far and where twill not extend thither he darts it bosom up my counsel youll find it wholesome lo where comes that rock that i advise your shunning enter cardinal wolsey the purse borne before him certain

ask god for temprance thats th appliance only which your disease requires buckingham i read ins looks matter against me and his eye revild me as his abject object at this instant he bores me with some trick hes gone to th king ill follow and outstare him norfolk stay my lord and let your reason with your choler question what tis you go about to climb steep hills requires slow pace at first anger is like a full hot horse who being allowd his way selfmettle tires him not a man in england can advise me like you be to yourself as you would to your friend buckingham ill to the king and from a mouth of honour quite cry down this ipswich fellows insolence or proclaim theres difference in no persons norfolk be advisd heat not a furnace for your foe so hot that it do singe yourself we may outrun by violent swiftness that which we run at and lose by overrunning know you not the fire that mounts the liquor tillt run oer in seeming to augment it wastes it be advisd i say again there is no english soul more stronger to direct you than yourself if with the sap of reason you would quench or but allay the fire of passion buckingham sir i am thankful to you and ill go along by your prescription but this topproud fellow whom from the flow of gan i name not but from sincere motions by intelligence and proofs as clear as founts in july when we see each grain of graveli do know to be corrupt and treasonous norfolk say not treasonous buckingham to th king ill sayt and make my vouch as strong as shore of rock attend this holy fox or wolf or bothfor he is equal ravnous as he is subtle and as prone to mischief as able to performt his mind and place infecting one another yea reciprocally only to show his pomp as well in france as here at home suggests the king our master to this last costly treaty th interview that swallowed so much treasure and like a glass did break i th wrenching norfolk faith and so it did buckingham pray give me favour sir this cunning cardinal the articles o th combination drew as himself pleasd and they were ratified as he cried thus let be to as much end as give a crutch to th dead but our countcardinal has done this and tis well for worthy wolsey who cannot err he did it now this follows which as i take it is a kind of puppy to th old dam treason charles the emperor under pretence to see the queen his aunt for twas indeed his colour but he came to whisper wolseyhere makes visitation his fears were that the interview betwixt england and france might through their amity breed him some prejudice for from this league peepd harms that menacd himprivily deals with our cardinal and as i trow which i do well for i am sure the emperor paid ere he promisd whereby his suit was granted ere it was askdbut when the way was made and pavd with gold the emperor thus desird that he would please to alter the kings course and break the foresaid peace let the king know as soon he shall by me that thus the cardinal does buy and sell his honour as he pleases and for his own advantage norfolk i am sorry to hear this of him and could wish he were something mistaken int buckingham no not a syllable i do pronounce him in that very shape he shall appear in proof enter brandon a sergeantatarms before him and two or three of the guard brandon your office sergeant execute it sergeant sir my lord the duke of buckingham and earl of hereford

thank your majesty that you would love yourself and in that love not unconsidered leave your honour nor the dignity of your office is the point of my petition king lady mine proceed queen katharine i am solicited not by a few and those of true condition that your subjects are in great grievance there have been commissions sent down among em which hath flawd the heart of all their loyalties wherein although my good lord cardinal they vent reproaches most bitterly on you as putteron of these exactions yet the king our master whose honour heaven shield from soileven he escapes not language unmannerly yea such which breaks the sides of loyalty and almost appears in loud rebellion norfolk not almost appears it doth appear for upon these taxations the clothiers all not able to maintain the many to them longing have put of the spinsters carders fullers weavers who unfit for other life compelld by hunger and lack of other means in desperate manner daring th event to th teeth are all in uproar and danger serves among them king taxation wherein and what taxation my lord cardinal you that are blamd for it alike with us know you of this taxation wolsey please you sir i know but of a single part in aught pertains to th state and front but in that file where others tell steps with me queen katharine no my lord you know no more than others but you frame things that are known alike which are not wholesome to those which would not know them and yet must perforce be their acquaintance these exactions whereof my sovereign would have note they are most pestilent to th hearing and to bear em the back is sacrifice to th load they say they are devisd by you or else you suffer too hard an exclamation king still exaction the nature of it in what kind lets know is this exaction queen katharine i am much too venturous in tempting of your patience but am boldned under your promisd pardon the subjects grief comes through commissions which compels from each the sixth part of his substance to be levied without delay and the pretence for this is namd your wars in france this makes bold mouths tongues spit their duties out and cold hearts freeze allegiance in them their curses now live where their prayers did and its come to pass this tractable obedience is a slave to each incensed will i would your highness would give it quick consideration for there is no primer business king by my life this is against our pleasure wolsey and for me i have no further gone in this than by a single voice and that not passd me but by learned approbation of the judges if i am traducd by ignorant tongues which neither know my faculties nor person yet will be the chronicles of my doing let me say tis but the fate of place and the rough brake that virtue must go through we must not stint our necessary actions in the fear to cope malicious censurers which ever as ravnous fishes do a vessel follow that is newtrimmd but benefit no further than vainly longing what we oft do best by sick interpreters once weak ones is not ours or not allowd what worst as oft hitting a grosser quality is cried up for our best act if we shall stand still in fear our motion will be mockd or carpd at we should take root here where we sit or sit statestatues only king things done well and with a care exempt themselves from fear things done without example in their issue are to be feard have you a precedent of this commission i believe not any we must not rend our subjects from our laws and stick them in our will sixth part of each a trembling contribution why we take from every tree lop bark and part o th timber and though we leave it with a root thus hackd the air will drink the sap to every county where this is questiond send our letters with free pardon to each man that has denied the force of this commission pray look tot i put it to your care wolsey aside to the secretary a word with you let there be letters writ to every shire of the kings grace and pardon the grieved commons

lawrence poultney did of me demand what was the speech among the londoners concerning the french journey i replied men feard the french would prove perfidious to the kings danger presently the duke said twas the fear indeed and that he doubted twould prove the verity of certain words spoke by a holy monk that oft says he hath sent to me wishing me to permit john de la car my chaplain a choice

competitor from alexandria this is the news he fishes drinks and wastes the lamps of night in revel is not more manlike than cleopatra nor the queen of ptolemy more womanly than he hardly gave audience or vouchsafd to think he had partners you shall find there a man who is the abstract of all faults that all men follow lepidus i must not think there are evils enow to darken all his goodness his faults in him seem as the spots of heaven more fiery by nights blackness hereditary rather than purchasd what he cannot change than what he chooses caesar you are too indulgent lets grant it is not amiss to tumble on the bed of ptolemy to give a kingdom for a mirth to sit and keep the turn of tippling with a slave to reel the streets at noon and stand the buffet with knaves that smell of sweat say this becomes him as his composure must be rare indeed whom these things cannot blemish yet must antony no way excuse his foils when we do bear so great weight in his lightness if he filld his vacancy with his voluptuousness full surfeits and the dryness of his bones call on him fort but to confound such time that drums him from his sport and speaks as loud as his own state and ours tis

beaten from modena where thou slewst hirtius and pansa consuls at thy heel did famine follow whom thou foughtst against though daintily brought up with patience more than savages could suffer thou

barks of trees thou browsd on the alps it is reported thou didst eat strange flesh which some did die to look on and all this it wounds thine honour that i speak it now was borne so like a soldier

by laying defects of judgment to me but you patchd up your excuses antony not so not so i know you could not lack i am certain ont very necessity of this thought that i your partner in the cause
