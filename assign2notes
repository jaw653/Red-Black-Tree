To Do:
------
-change displayBST() to have format for this new project, must use a queue
-must figure out statisticsBST()
-does insertBST() need to account for duplicate values?
	-->nope, "all key values are unique"
-does findBST() need to account for the value not being in the tree?
-is swapToLeaf() currently swapping to the correct leaf (pred vs succes)
-does removeBST() need to account for empty tree/value not in tree?
	-->so if tree is empty, should it say value not found or print another
	message?
-currently findBST() and deleteBST() will print error messages and exit, is
	this OK?
-test trying to deleteBST() a NULL value and see what happens
-do I need to add any specific assertions?
-need to figure out how to get rid of final whitespace in printLevel() in bst.c

rbt To Do:
----------
-HOW DO I GO ABOUT HANDLING INSERTING THE SAME VALUE???
-constructor/struct, might need some more blocks of mem in there for freq
-so if I'm correct, the value inserted into the rbt will be a struct that
	holds the color/frequency/any other pertinent information?
-do we need to account for trying to rotate when one of the needed nodes is
	null?
-still need to update frequency in phrase object, rn it just stays 0
-how to handle the user requesting to delete a value that is not in the tree
-seg faults that may occur may be due to not checking if a given node
	exists, for example calling getnodeR() when there is no nodeR...
-BE CAREFUL, NULL POINTERS SHOULD COUNT AS RED WHEN LOOKING AT:
	if (parent[or others] are red) then...
-after deletionfixup, what value should i be pruning()?
-right now, swapping entire structs, need to maintain colorings...
-deleting should decrement the freq, then when freq==0, remove node
-haven't tested the findRBT() fc yet b/c frequency is not yet accounted for

trees.c to do:
--------------
-check to see if empty files?
-should I print an error message if there are no command line arguments, should I do something else w/ 
	the program?

General Miscellaneous:
----------------------
-what's the difference when you print to stderr?
-MUST USE THE TEST2 DROPBOX PRIOR TO SUBMISSION
