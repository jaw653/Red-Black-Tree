To Do:
------
-must figure out statisticsBST()
-does insertBST() need to account for duplicate values?
-does findBST() need to account for the value not being in the tree?
-is swapToLeaf() currently swapping to the correct leaf (pred vs succes)
-does removeBST() need to account for empty tree/value not in tree?
-currently findBST() and deleteBST() will print error messages and exit, is
	this OK?
-test trying to deleteBST() a NULL value and see what happens
